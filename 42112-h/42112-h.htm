<p class="caption2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</p>


<p>Twenty-five years ago, this date, a company of gentlemen
were encamped at the Forks of the Madison
River in what is now the Yellowstone National Park.
They had just finished the first complete tour of exploration
ever made of that region. Fully realizing the importance
of all they had seen, they asked what ought
to be done to preserve so unique an assemblage of
wonders to the uses for which Nature had evidently
designed them. It required no argument to show
that government protection alone was equal to the
task, and it was agreed that a movement to secure
such protection should be inaugurated at once. So
rapidly did events develop along the line of this idea,
that within the next eighteen months the &ldquo;Act of
Dedication&rdquo; had become a law, and the Yellowstone
National Park took its place in our country&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>The wide-spread interest which the discovery of this
region created among civilized peoples has in no degree
diminished with the lapse of time. In this country
particularly the Park to-day stands on a firmer
basis than ever before. The events of the past two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
years, in matters of legislation and administration,
have increased many fold the assurances of its continued
preservation, and have shown that even the
petty local hostility, which has now and then menaced
its existence, is yielding to a wiser spirit of
patriotism.</p>

<p>The time therefore seems opportune, in passing so
important an epoch in the history of the Park, and
while many of the actors in its earlier scenes are still
among us, to collect the essential facts, historical and
descriptive, relating to this region, and to place them
in form for permanent preservation. The present literature
of the Park, although broad in scope and exhaustive
in detail, is unfortunately widely scattered,
somewhat difficult of access, and in matters of early
history, notably deficient. To supply a work which
shall form a complete and connected treatment of the
subject, is the purpose of the present volume.</p>

<p>It deals first and principally with the history of the
Upper Yellowstone from the days of Lewis and Clark
to the present time. The main text is supplemented
by a considerable amount of appendical matter, the
most important features of which are a complete list
of the geographical names of the Park, with their
origin and signification; a few biographical sketches
of the early explorers; and a bibliography of the literature
pertaining to this region.</p>

<p>The descriptive portion of the work contains a succinct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
though comprehensive, treatment of the various
scientific and popular features of the Park. While it
is sufficient for all the requirements of ordinary information,
it purposely refrains from a minute discussion
of those details which have been, or are now
being, exhaustively treated by the scientific departments
of the government.</p>

<p>In describing a region whose fame rests upon its
natural wonders, the assistance of the illustrative art
has naturally been resorted to. The various accompanying
maps have all been prepared especially for
this work and are intended to set forth not only present
geography but historical features as well. The
folded map embodies every thing to date from the
latest geographical surveys. It will bear careful study,
and this has been greatly simplified by a system of
marginal references to be used with the list of names
in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>The illustrations cover every variety of subject in
the Park and represent the best results of photographic
work in that region. They are mostly from the studio
of Mr. F. J. Haynes, of St. Paul, the well-known
Park photographer, who has done so much by his art
to disseminate a knowledge of the wonders of the
Yellowstone. A considerable number are from views
taken during the Hayden surveys by Mr. William H.
Jackson, now of Denver, Colorado. A few excellent
subjects are from the amateur work of Captain C. M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Gandy, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A., who was stationed
for some years on duty in the Park. The portraits
are restricted to the few early explorers who visited
the Upper Yellowstone prior to the creation of the
Park.</p>

<p>To any one who is familiar with the recent history
of the Park, a work like the present would seem incomplete
without some reference to those influences
which endanger its future existence. A brief discussion
of this subject is accordingly presented, which,
without considering particular schemes, exposes the
dangerous tendencies underlying them all.</p>

<p>In the course of a somewhat extended correspondence
connected with the preparation of this work, the
author has become indebted for much information
that could not be found in the existing literature of
the Park. He desires in this place to return his
sincere acknowledgments to all who have assisted
him, and to refer in a special manner.</p>

<p>To the Hon. N. P. Langford, of St. Paul, whose
long acquaintance with the Upper Yellowstone country
has made him an authority upon its history.</p>

<p>To Dr. Elliott Coues, of Washington, D. C., who
has contributed, besides much general assistance, the
essential facts relating to the name &ldquo;Yellowstone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Captain George S. Anderson, 6th U. S. Cavalry,
Superintendent of the Park, for the use of his extensive
collection of Park literature.</p>

<p class="caption3">&ldquo;YELLOWSTONE.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Lewis and Clark passed the first winter of their
famous trans-continental expedition among the Mandan
Indians, on the Missouri River, sixty-six miles
above the present capital of North Dakota. When
about to resume their journey in the spring of 1805,
they sent back to President Jefferson a report of
progress and a map of the western country based
upon information derived from the Indians. In this
report and upon this map appear for the first time,
in any official document, the words &ldquo;Yellow Stone&rdquo;
as the name of the principal tributary of the Missouri.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that Lewis and Clark were not
the first actually to use the name. David Thompson,
the celebrated explorer and geographer, prominently
identified with the British fur trade in the North-west,
was among the Mandan Indians on the Missouri
River from December 29, 1797, to January 10,
1798. While there he secured data, mostly from the
natives, from which he estimated the latitude and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
longitude of the source of the Yellowstone River. In
his original manuscript journal and field note-books,
containing the record of his determinations, the words
&ldquo;Yellow Stone&rdquo; appear precisely as used by Lewis
and Clark in 1805. This is, perhaps, the first use of
the name in its Anglicised form, and it is certainly
the first attempt to determine accurately the geographical
location of the source of the stream.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a>

</div>

<p>Neither Thompson nor Lewis and Clark were
originators of the name. They gave us only the
English translation of a name already long in use.
&ldquo;This river,&rdquo; say Lewis and Clark, in their journal
for the day of their arrival at the mouth of the now
noted stream, &ldquo;had been known to the French as the
<i>Roche Jaune</i>, or, as we have called it, the Yellow
Stone.&rdquo; The French name was, in fact, already
firmly established among the traders and trappers of
the North-west Fur Company, when Lewis and Clark
met them among the Mandans. Even by the members
of the expedition it seems to have been more
generally used than the new English form; and the
spellings, &ldquo;Rejone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rejhone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rochejone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rochejohn,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Rochejhone,&rdquo; are among their various
attempts to render orthographically the French pronunciation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably the name would have been adopted unchanged,
as so many other French names in our
geography have been, except for the recent cession
of Louisiana to the United States. The policy which
led the government promptly to explore, and take
formal possession of, its extensive acquisition, led it
also, as part of the process of rapid Americanization,
to give English names to all of the more prominent
geographical features. In the case of the name here
under consideration, this was no easy matter. The
French form had already obtained wide currency, and
it was reluctantly set aside for its less familiar translation.
As late as 1817, it still appeared in newly
English-printed books,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> while among the traders and
trappers of the mountains, it survived to a much later
period.</p>

&ldquo;Travels in the Interior of America.&rdquo; See <a href="#bibl_115">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>By whom the name <i>Roche Jaune</i>, or its equivalent
form <i>Pierre Jaune</i>, was first used, it would be extremely
interesting to know; but it is impossible to
determine at this late day. Like their successor,
&ldquo;Yellow Stone,&rdquo; these names were not originals, but
only translations. The Indian tribes along the Yellowstone
and upper Missouri rivers had names for the
tributary stream signifying &ldquo;yellow rock,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and the
French had doubtless adopted them long before any
of their number saw the stream itself.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> The
name &ldquo;Elk River&rdquo; was also used among the Crow Indians.</p></div>

<p>The first explorations of the country comprised
within the present limits of the State of Montana are
matters of great historic uncertainty. By one account
it appears that, between the years 1738 and 1753,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, the Sieur de la Verendrye,
and his sons, particularly the Chevalier de la
Verendrye, conducted parties of explorers westward,
from Lake Superior to the Assinnaboine River, thence
south to the Mandan country, and thence to the very
sources of the Missouri. Even the date, January 12,
1743, is given for their first ascent of the Rocky
Mountains. But such is the dearth of satisfactory
evidence relating to these explorations, that positive
inferences concerning them are impossible. The
most that can be said is, that if De la Verendrye
visited these regions, as is generally believed, to him
doubtless belongs the honor of having adopted from
original sources the name of the Yellowstone River.</p>

<p>The goal of De la Verendrye&rsquo;s explorations was the
Pacific Ocean; but the French and Indian war which
robbed France of her dominion in America, prevented
his ever reaching it. Following him, at the distance
of nearly half a century, came the traders and trappers
of the North-west Fur Company. As already
noted, they were among the Mandans as early as 1797,
and the name <i>Roche Jaune</i> was in common use among
them in 1804. They appear to have been wholly ignorant
of the work of De la Verendrye, and it is
quite certain that, prior to 1805, none of them had
reached the Yellowstone River. Lewis and Clark
particularly record the fact, while yet some distance
below the junction of this river with the Missouri,
that they had already passed the utmost limit of previous
adventure by white men. Whatever, therefore,
was at this time known of the Yellowstone could
have come to these traders only from Indian
sources.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> An
interesting reference to the name &ldquo;Yellowstone,&rdquo; in an
entirely different quarter, occurs on Pike&rsquo;s map of the &ldquo;Internal
Provinces of Spain,&rdquo; published in 1810. It is a corrupt Spanish
translation in the form of &ldquo;<i>Rio de Piedro Amaretto del Missouri</i>,&rdquo;
(intended of course to be <i>Rio de la Piedra Amarilla del Missouri</i>)
river of the Yellow Stone of the Missouri. No clue has been discovered
of the source from which Pike received this name; but
the fact of its existence need occasion no surprise. The Spanish
had long traded as far north as the Shoshone country, and had
mingled with the French traders along the lower Missouri. Lewis
and Clark found articles of their manufacture among the Shoshones
in 1805. There is also limited evidence of early intercourse
between them and the Crow nation. That the name of so important
a stream as the Yellowstone should have become known
to these traders is therefore not at all remarkable. There is, however,
no reason to suppose that the Spanish translation antedates
the French. It certainly plays no part in the descent of the name
from the original to the English form, and it is of interest in this
connection mainly as showing that, even at this early day, the
name had found its way to the provinces of the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p></div>

<p>We thus find that the name, which has now become
so celebrated, descends to us, through two translations,
from those native races whose immemorial
dwelling-place had been along the stream which it
describes. What it was that led them to use the
name is easily discoverable. The Yellowstone River
is pre-eminently a river with banks of yellow rock.
Along its lower course &ldquo;the flood plain is bordered
by high bluffs of yellow sandstone.&rdquo; Near the mouth
of the Bighorn River stands the noted landmark,
Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar, &ldquo;a high isolated rock&rdquo; of the same
material. Still further up, beyond the mouth of
Clark&rsquo;s fork, is an extensive ridge of yellow rock, the
&ldquo;sheer, vertical sides&rdquo; of which, according to one
writer, &ldquo;gleam in the sunlight like massive gold.&rdquo;
All along the lower river, in fact, from its mouth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the Great Bend at Livingston, this characteristic is
more or less strikingly present.</p>

<p>Whether it forms a sufficiently prominent feature of
the landscape to justify christening the river from it,
may appear to be open to doubt. At any rate the
various descriptions of this valley by early explorers
rarely refer to the same locality as being conspicuous
from the presence of yellow rock. Some mention it
in one place, some in another. Nowhere does it seem
to have been so striking as to attract the attention of
all observers. For this reason we shall go further in
search of the true origin of the name, to a locality
about which there can be no doubt, no difference of
opinion.</p>

<p>Seventy-five miles below the ultimate source of the
river lies the Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone, distinguished
among the notable cañons of the globe by
the marvelous coloring of its walls. Conspicuous
among its innumerable tints is yellow. Every shade,
from the brilliant plumage of the yellow bird to the
rich saffron of the orange, greets the eye in bewildering
profusion. There is indeed other color, unparalleled
in variety and abundance, but the ever-present
background of all is the beautiful fifth color of the
spectrum.</p>

<p>So prominent is this feature that it never fails to
attract attention, and all descriptions of the Cañon
abound in references to it. Lieutenant Doane (1870)
notes the &ldquo;brilliant yellow color&rdquo; of the rocks. Captain
Barlow and Doctor Hayden (1871) refer, in almost
the same words, to the &ldquo;yellow, nearly vertical walls.&rdquo;
Raymond (1871) speaks of the &ldquo;bright yellow of the
sulphury clay.&rdquo; Captain Jones (1873) says that "about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and in the Grand Cañon the rocks are nearly all tinged
a brilliant yellow." These early impressions might be
repeated from the writings of every subsequent visitor
who has described the scenery of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>That a characteristic which so deeply moves the
modern beholder should have made a profound impression
on the mind of the Indian, need hardly be
premised. This region was by no means unknown to
him; and from the remote, although uncertain, period
of his first acquaintance with it, the name of the river
has undoubtedly descended.</p>

<p>Going back, then, to this obscure fountain-head, the
original designation is found to have been</p>

<p class="caption2">INDIAN OCCUPANCY OF THE UPPER YELLOWSTONE.</p>


<p>It is a singular fact in the history of the Yellowstone
National Park that no knowledge of that country
seems to have been derived from the Indians. The explanation
ordinarily advanced is that the Indians had
a superstitious fear of the geyser regions and always
avoided them. How far this theory is supported by the
results of modern research is an interesting inquiry.</p>

<p>Three great families of Indians, the Siouan, the Algonquian,
and the Shoshonean, originally occupied the
country around the sources of the Yellowstone. Of
these three families the following tribes are alone of
interest in this connection: The Crows (<i>Absaroka</i>) of
the Siouan family; the Blackfeet (<i>Siksika</i>) of the Algonquian
family; and the Bannocks (<i>Panai&rsquo;hti</i>), the
Eastern Shoshones, and the Sheepeaters (<i>Tukuarika</i>)
of the Shoshonean family.</p>

<p>The home of the Crows was in the Valley of the Yellowstone
below the mountains where they have dwelt
since the white man&rsquo;s earliest knowledge of them. Their
territory extended to the mountains which bound the
Yellowstone Park on the north and east; but they
never occupied or claimed any of the country beyond.
Their well-known tribal characteristics were an insatiable
love of horse-stealing and a wandering and predatory
habit which caused them to roam over all the
West from the Black Hills to the Bitter Root Mountains
and from the British Possessions to the Spanish Provinces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
They were generally, although by no means
always, friendly to the whites, but enemies of the
neighboring Blackfeet and Shoshones. Physically,
they were a stalwart, handsome race, fine horsemen
and daring hunters. They were every-where encountered
by the trapper and prospector who generally
feared them more on account of their thievish habits
than for reasons of personal safety.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet dwelt in the country drained by the
headwaters of the Missouri. Their territory was
roughly defined by the Crow territory on the east and
the Rocky Mountains on the west. Its southern limit
was the range of mountains along the present north-west
border of the Park and it extended thence to
the British line. The distinguishing historic trait of
these Indians was their settled hostility to their neighbors
whether white or Indian. They were a tribe
of perpetual fighters, justly characterized as the Ishmaelites
of their race. From the day in 1806, when
Captain Lewis slew one of their number, down to
their final subjection by the advancing power of the
whites, they never buried the hatchet. They were
the terror of the trapper and miner, and hundreds
of the pioneers perished at their hands. Like the
Crows they were a well-developed race, good horsemen
and great rovers, but, in fight, given to subterfuge
and stratagem rather than to open boldness of
action.</p>

<p>In marked contrast with these warlike and wandering
tribes were those of the great Shoshonean family
who occupied the country around the southern, eastern,
and western borders of the Park, including also
that of the Park itself. The Shoshones as a family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
were an inferior race. They seem to have been the
victims of some great misfortune which had driven
them to precarious methods of subsistence and had
made them the prey of their powerful and merciless
neighbors. The names &ldquo;Fish-eaters,&rdquo; &ldquo;Root-diggers,&rdquo;
and other opprobrious epithets, indicate the
contempt in which they were commonly held. For
the most part they had no horses, and obtained a livelihood
only by the most abject means. Some of the
tribes, however, rose above this degraded condition,
owned horses, hunted buffalo, and met their enemies
in open conflict. Such were the Bannocks and the
Eastern Shoshones&mdash;tribes closely connected with the
history of the Park, one occupying the country to the
south-west near the Teton Mountains, and the other
that to the south-east in the valley of Wind River.
The Shoshones were generally friendly to the whites,
and for this reason they figure less prominently in the
books of early adventure than do the Crows and
Blackfeet whose acts of &ldquo;sanguinary violence&rdquo; were
a staple article for the Indian romancer.</p>

<p>It was an humble branch of the Shoshonean family
which alone is known to have permanently occupied
what is now the Yellowstone Park. They were called
<i>Tukuarika</i>, or, more commonly, Sheepeaters. They
were found in the Park country at the time of its
discovery and had doubtless long been there. These
hermits of the mountains, whom the French trappers
called &ldquo;<i>les dignes de pitié</i>,&rdquo; have engaged the sympathy
or contempt of explorers since our earliest knowledge
of them. Utterly unfit for warlike contention, they
seem to have sought immunity from their dangerous
neighbors by dwelling among the inaccessible fastnesses
of the mountains. They were destitute of
even savage comforts. Their food, as their name indicates,
was principally the flesh of the mountain
sheep. Their clothing was composed of skins. They
had no horses and were armed only with bows and
arrows. They captured game by driving it into
brush inclosures. Their rigorous existence left its
mark on their physical nature. They were feeble in
mind, diminutive in stature, and are always described
as a &ldquo;timid, harmless race.&rdquo; They may have been
longer resident in this region than is commonly supposed,
for there was a tradition among them, apparently
connected with some remote period of geological
disturbance, that most of their race were once destroyed
by a terrible convulsion of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the Indian tribes who formerly dwelt
within or near the country now embraced in the Yellowstone
National Park. That the Sheepeaters actually
occupied this country, and that wandering
bands from other tribes occasionally visited it, there
is abundant and conclusive proof. Indian
trails,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
though generally indistinct, were every-where found
by the early explorers, mostly on lines since occupied
by the tourist routes. One of these followed the Yellowstone
Valley entirely across the Park from north to
south. It divided at Yellowstone Lake, the principal
branch following the east shore, crossing Two-Ocean-Pass,
and intersecting a great trail which connected
the Snake and Wind River Valleys. The other
branch passed along the west shore of the lake and
over the divide to the valleys of Snake River and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Jackson Lake. This trail was intersected by an important
one in the vicinity of Conant Creek leading
from the Upper Snake Valley to that of Henry Fork.
Other intersecting trails connected the Yellowstone
River trail with the Madison and Firehole Basins
on the west and with the Bighorn Valley on the
east.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> See
<a href="#HistoricalChart">historical chart</a>, opposite.</p></div>

<p>The most important Indian trail in the Park, however,
was that known as the Great Bannock Trail.
It extended from Henry Lake across the Gallatin
Range to Mammoth Hot Springs, where it was joined
by another coming up the valley of the Gardiner.
Thence it led across the Black-tail Deer plateau to
the ford above Tower Falls; and thence up the Lamar
Valley, forking at Soda Butte, and reaching the Bighorn
Valley by way of Clark&rsquo;s Fork and the Stinkingwater
River. This trail was certainly a very ancient
and much-traveled one. It had become a deep furrow
in the grassy slopes, and it is still distinctly visible in
places, though unused for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Additional evidence in the same direction may be
seen in the wide-spread distribution of implements
peculiar to Indian use. Arrows and spear heads have
been found in considerable numbers. Obsidian Cliff
was an important quarry, and the open country near
the outlet of Yellowstone Lake a favorite camping-ground.
Certain implements, such as pipes, hammers,
and stone vessels, indicating the former presence of a
more civilized people, have been found to a limited
extent; and some explorers have thought that a symmetrical
mound in the valley of the Snake River, below
the mouth of Hart River, is of artificial origin.
Reference will later be made to the discovery of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
rude granite structure near the top of the Grand
Teton, which is unquestionably of very ancient date.</p>

<p>Dr. A. C. Peale, prominently connected with the
early geological explorations of this region, states that
the Rustic Geyser in the Hart Lake Geyser Basin is
&ldquo;bordered by logs which are coated with a crystalline,
semi-translucent deposit of geyserite. These logs
were evidently placed around the geyser by either Indians
or white men a number of years ago, as the
coating is thick and the logs firmly attached to the
surrounding deposit.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Page 298,
Twelfth Annual Report of Dr. Hayden. See <a href="#bibl_11">Appendix E</a>.
It is more than probable that this was the work of
trappers.</p></div>

<p>More recent and perishable proofs of the presence
of Indians in the Park were found by the early explorers
in the rude wick-e-ups, brush inclosures, and
similar contrivances of the lonely Sheepeaters; and it
is not improbable that many of the arrow and spear
heads were the work of these Indians.</p>

<p>The real question of doubt in regard to Indian occupancy
of, or visits to, the Park, is therefore not one
of fact, but of degree. The Sheepeaters certainly
dwelt there; but as to other tribes, their acquaintance
with it seems to have been very limited. No word of
information about the geyser regions ever fell from
their lips, except that the surrounding country was
known to them as the Burning Mountains. With
one or two exceptions, the old trails were very indistinct,
requiring an experienced eye to distinguish
them from game trails. Their undeveloped condition
indicated infrequent use. Old trappers who have
known this region for fifty years say that the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
majority of Indians never saw it. Able Indian
guides in the surrounding country became lost when
they entered the Park, and the Nez Percés were
forced to impress a white man as guide when they
crossed the Park in 1877.</p>

<p>An unknown writer, to whom extended reference
will be made in a later chapter, visited the Upper
Geyser Basin in 1832, accompanied by two Pend
d&rsquo;Oreilles Indians. Neither of these Indians had ever
seen or apparently heard of the geysers, and &ldquo;were
quite appalled&rdquo; at the sight of them, believing them
to be &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; and the &ldquo;production of the
Evil Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Doane, who commanded the military
escort to the Yellowstone Expedition of 1870, says in
his report:<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Appearances indicated that the basin [of the Yellowstone
Lake] had been almost entirely abandoned
by the sons of the forest. A few lodges of Sheepeaters,
a branch remnant of the Snake tribe, wretched
beasts who run from the sight of a white man, or
from any other tribe of Indians, are said to inhabit
the fastnesses of the mountains around the lakes,
poorly armed and dismounted, obtaining a precarious
subsistence, and in a defenseless condition. We saw,
however, no recent traces of them. The larger tribes
never enter the basin, restrained by superstitious ideas
in connection with the thermal springs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1880, Col. P. W. Norris, Second Superintendent
of the Park, had a long interview on the shore of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Yellowstone Lake with We-Saw, &ldquo;an old but remarkably
intelligent Indian&rdquo; of the Shoshone tribe, who
was then acting as guide to an exploring party under
Governor Hoyt, of Wyoming, and who had previously
passed through the Park with the expedition of 1873
under Captain W. A. Jones, U. S. A. He had also
been in the Park region on former occasions. Colonel
Norris records the following facts from this Indian&rsquo;s
conversation:<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We-Saw states that he had neither knowledge nor
tradition of any permanent occupants of the Park
save the timid Sheepeaters&#8230;. He said that
his people (Shoshones) the Bannocks and the Crows,
occasionally visited the Yellowstone Lake and River
portions of the Park, but very seldom the geyser regions,
which he declared were &lsquo;<i>heap, heap, bad</i>,&rsquo; and
never wintered there, as white men sometimes did
with horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems that even the resident Sheepeaters knew
little of the geyser basins. General Sheridan, who
entered the Park from the south in 1882, makes this
record in his report of the
expedition:<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We had with us five Sheep Eating Indians as
guides, and, strange to say, although these Indians
had lived for years and years about Mounts Sheridan
and Hancock, and the high mountains south-east of
the Yellowstone Lake, they knew nothing about the
Firehole Geyser Basin, and they exhibited more
astonishment and wonder than any of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidence like the foregoing clearly indicates that
this country was <i>terra incognita</i> to the vast body of
Indians who dwelt around it, and again this singular
fact presents itself for explanation. Was it, as is
generally supposed, a &ldquo;superstitious fear&rdquo; that kept
them away? The incidents just related give
some color to such a theory; but if it were really
true we should expect to find well authenticated Indian
traditions of so marvelous a country. Unfortunately
history records none. It is not meant by this
to imply that reputed traditions concerning the Yellowstone
are unknown. For instance, it is related
that the Crows always refused to tell the whites of
the geysers because they believed that whoever
visited them became endowed with supernatural
powers, and they wished to retain a monopoly of this
knowledge. But traditions of this sort, like most Indian
curiosities now offered for sale, are evidently of
spurious origin. Only in the names &ldquo;Yellowstone&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Burning Mountains&rdquo; do we find any original
evidence that this land of wonders appealed in the
least degree to the native imagination.</p>

<p>The real explanation of this remarkable ignorance
appears to us to rest on grounds essentially practical.
There was nothing to induce the Indians to visit the
Park country. For three-fourths of the year that
country is inaccessible on account of snow. It is
covered with dense forests, which in most places are
so filled with fallen timber and tangled underbrush as
to be practically impassable. As a game country in
those early days it could not compare with the lower
surrounding valleys. As a highway of communication
between the valleys of the Missouri, Snake, Yellowstone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and Bighorn Rivers, it was no thoroughfare.
The great routes, except the Bannock trail already
described, lay on the outside. All the conditions,
therefore, which might attract the Indians to this region
were wanting. Even those sentimental influences,
such as a love of sublime scenery and a
curiosity to see the strange freaks of nature, evidently
had less weight with them than with their pale-face
brethren.</p>

<p>Summarizing the results of such knowledge, confessedly
meager, as exists upon this subject, it appears:</p>

<p>(1.) That the country now embraced in the Yellowstone
National Park was occupied, at the time of its
discovery, by small bands of Sheepeater Indians, probably
not exceeding in number one hundred and fifty
souls. They dwelt in the neighborhood of the Washburn
and Absaroka Ranges, and among the mountains
around the sources of the Snake. They were not
familiar with the geyser regions.</p>

<p>(2.) Wandering bands from other tribes occasionally
visited this country, but generally along the line of
the Yellowstone River or the Great Bannock Trail.
Their knowledge of the geyser regions was extremely
limited, and very few had ever seen or heard of them.
It is probable that the Indians visited this country
more frequently in earlier times than since the advent
of the white man.</p>

<p>(3.) The Indians avoided the region of the Upper
Yellowstone from practical, rather than from sentimental,
considerations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The legal processes by which the vast territory of
these various tribes passed to the United States, are full
of incongruities resulting from a general ignorance of the
country in question. By the Treaty of Fort Laramie,
dated September 17, 1851, between the United States
on the one hand, and the Crows, Blackfeet and other
northern tribes on the other, the Crows were given,
as part of their territory, all that portion of the Park
country which lies east of the Yellowstone River;
and the Blackfeet, all that portion lying between the
Yellowstone River and the Continental Divide. This
was before any thing whatever was known of the
country so given away. None of the Shoshone tribes
were party to the treaty, and the rights of the
Sheepeaters were utterly ignored. That neither the
Blackfeet nor the Crows had any real claim to these
extravagant grants is evidenced by their prompt relinquishment
of them in the first subsequent treaties.
Thus, by treaty of October 17, 1855, the Blackfeet
agreed that all of their portion of the Park country,
with much other territory, should be and remain a
common hunting ground for certain designated tribes;
and by treaty of May 17, 1868, the Crows relinquished
all of their territory south of the Montana boundary
line.</p>

<p>That portion of the Park country drained by the Snake
River was always considered Shoshone territory, although
apparently never formally recognized in any
public treaty. By an unratified treaty, dated September
24, 1868, the provisions of which seem to have been the
basis of subsequent arrangements with the Shoshonean
tribes, all this territory and much besides was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ceded to the United States, and the tribes were located
upon small reservations.</p>

<p>It thus appears that at the time the Park was
created, March 1, 1872, all the territory included in
its limits had been ceded to the United States except
the hunting ground above referred to, and the narrow
strip of Crow territory east of the Yellowstone where
the north boundary of the Park lies two or three
miles north of the Montana line. The &ldquo;hunting
ground&rdquo; arrangement was abrogated by statute of
April 15, 1874, and the strip of Crow territory was
purchased under an agreement with the Crows, dated
June 12, 1880, and ratified by Congress, April 11,
1882, thus extinguishing the last remaining Indian
title to any portion of the Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p class="caption2">JOHN COLTER.</p>


<p>Lewis and Clark passed the second winter of their expedition
at the mouth of the Columbia River. In the
spring and summer of 1806 they accomplished their return
to St. Louis. Upon their arrival at the site of
their former winter quarters among the Mandans, an incident
occurred which forms the initial point in the
history of the Yellowstone National Park. It is thus
recorded in the journal of the expedition under date
of August 14 and 15, 1806:<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the evening we were applied to by one of our
men, Colter, who was desirous of joining the two trappers
who had accompanied us, and who now proposed
an expedition up the river, in which they were to find
traps and give him a share of the profits. The offer
was a very advantageous one, and, as he had always
performed his duty, and his services might be dispensed
with, we agreed that he might go provided none of the
rest would ask or expect a similar indulgence. To this
they cheerfully answered that they wished Colter every
success and would not apply for liberty to separate before
we reached St. Louis. We therefore supplied
him, as did his comrades also, with powder, lead, and
a variety of articles which might be useful to him, and
he left us the next day.&rdquo;</p>

Coues' &ldquo;Lewis and Clark.&rdquo; See <a href="#bibl_57">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>To our explorers, just returning from a two years'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sojourn in the wilderness, Colter&rsquo;s decision seemed too
remarkable to be passed over in silence. The journal
continues:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The example of this man shows us how easily men
may be weaned from the habits of civilized life to the
ruder but scarcely less fascinating manners of the
woods. This hunter has now been absent for many
years from the frontiers, and might naturally be presumed
to have some anxiety, or some curiosity at least,
to return to his friends and his country; yet just at the
moment when he is approaching the frontiers, he is
tempted by a hunting scheme to give up those delightful
prospects, and go back without the least reluctance
to the solitude of the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colter seems to have stood well in the esteem of
his officers. Besides the fair character given him in
his discharge, the record of the expedition shows that
he was frequently selected when one or two men were
required for important special duty. That he had a
good eye for topography may be inferred from the fact
that Captain Clark, several years after the expedition
was over, placed upon his map certain important information
on the strength of Colter&rsquo;s statements, who
alone had traversed the region in question. In another
instance, when Bradbury, the English naturalist, was
about to leave St. Louis to join the Astorians in
the spring of 1811, Clark referred him to Colter, who
had returned from the mountains, as a person who
could conduct him to a certain natural curiosity on the
Missouri some distance above St. Charles. Colter had
not seen the place for six years. In the <i>Missouri Gazette</i>,
for April 18, 1811, he is referred to as a &ldquo;celebrated
hunter and woodsman.&rdquo; These glimpses of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
record, and a remarkable incident to be related further
on, clearly indicate that he was a man of superior
mettle to that of the average hunter and trapper.</p>

<p>Colter&rsquo;s whereabouts during the three years following
his discharge are difficult to fix upon. It may,
however, be set down as certain that he and his companions
ascended the Yellowstone River, not the Missouri.
Captain Clark&rsquo;s return journey down the first-mentioned
stream had made known to them that it
was better beaver country than the Missouri, and
Colter&rsquo;s subsequent wanderings clearly indicate that
his base of operations was in the valley of the Yellowstone
near the mouth of the Bighorn, Pryor&rsquo;s Fork,
or other tributary stream.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1807, he made an expedition, apparently
alone, although probably in company with Indians,
which has given him title to a place in the history
of the Yellowstone Park, and which was destined
in later years to assume an importance little enough
suspected by him at the time. His route appears upon
Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s map of 1814, and is there called
&ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s route in 1807.&rdquo; There is no note or explanation,
and we are left to retrace, on the basis of a
dotted line, a few names, and a date, one of those
singular individual wanderings through the wilderness
which now and then find a permanent place in
history.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;route,&rdquo; as traced on the map, starts from a
point on Pryor&rsquo;s Fork, the first considerable tributary
of the Yellowstone above the mouth of the Bighorn.
Colter&rsquo;s intention seems to have been to skirt the eastern
base of the Absaroka Range until he should
reach an accessible pass across the mountains of which
the Indians had probably told him; then to cross
over to the headwaters of Pacific or gulf-flowing
streams; and then to return by way of the Upper Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after he had passed through Pryor&rsquo;s
Gap, he took a south-westerly direction as far as
Clark&rsquo;s Fork, which stream he ascended for some distance,
and then crossed over to the Stinkingwater.
Here he discovered a large boiling spring, strongly
impregnated with tar and sulphur, the odor of which,
perceptible for a great distance around, has given the
stream its &ldquo;unhappy name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this point Colter continued along the eastern
flank of the Absaroka Range, fording the several
tributaries of the Bighorn River which flow down
from that range, and finally came to the upper course
of the main stream now known as Wind River. He
ascended this stream to its source, crossing the divide
in the vicinity of Lincoln or Union Pass, and found
himself upon the Pacific slope. The map clearly
shows that at this point he had reached what the Indians
called the &ldquo;summit of the world&rdquo; near by the
sources of all great streams of the west. That he discovered
one of the easy passes between Wind River
and the Pacific slope, is evident from the reference in
the <i>Missouri Gazette</i> already alluded to and here reproduced
for the first time. It is from the pen of a
Mr. H. M. Brackenridge, a contemporary writer of
note on topics of western adventure. It reads:</p>

<p>"At the head of the Gallatin Fork, and of the
Grosse Corne of the Yellowstone [the Bighorn River],
from discoveries since the voyage of Lewis and Clark,
it is found less difficult to cross than the Allegheny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Mountains. Coulter, a celebrated hunter and woodsman,
informed me that a loaded wagon would find no
obstruction in passing."</p>

<p>The &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; are of course those of Colter, for
no other white man at this time had been in those
parts.</p>

<p>From the summit of the mountains he descended to
the westward; crossed the Snake River and Teton
Pass to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, and then turned north, recrossing
the Teton Range by the Indian trail in the
valley of what is now Conant Creek, just north of
Jackson Lake.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> Thence
he continued his course until he reached Yellowstone
Lake,<a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> at
some point along its south-western shore. He passed around the west
shore to the northernmost point of the Thumb, and
then resumed his northerly course over the hills arriving
at the Yellowstone River in the valley of Alum
Creek. He followed the left bank of the river to the
ford just above Tower Falls, where the great Bannock
Trail used to cross, and then followed this trail to its
junction with his outward route on Clark&rsquo;s Fork.
From this point he re-crossed to the Stinkingwater,
possibly in order to re-visit the strange phenomena
there, but more probably to explore new trapping territory
on his way back. He descended the Stinkingwater
until about south of Pryor&rsquo;s Gap, when he
turned north and shortly after arrived at his starting
point.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_L_12" id="Footnote_L_12"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_L_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> For
the names given by Captain Clark to these bodies of water,
see <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>, &ldquo;Jackson Lake&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yellowstone Lake.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The direction of Colter&rsquo;s progress, as here indicated,
and the identification of certain geographical features
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
noted by him, differ somewhat from the ordinary interpretation
of that adventure. But, while it would
be absurd to dogmatize upon so uncertain a subject, it
is believed that the theory adopted is fairly well supported
by the facts as now known. It must in the
first place be assumed that Colter exercised ordinary
common sense upon this journey and availed himself
of all information that could facilitate his progress.
It is probable that he was under the guidance of Indians
who knew the country; but if not, he frequently
stopped, like any traveler in an unknown region, to
inquire his way. He sought the established trails,
low mountain passes, and well-known fords, and did
not, as the map suggests, take a direction that would
carry him through the very roughest and most impassable
mountain country on the continent. It is
necessary to orient his map so as to make both his
outgoing and return routes extend nearly due north
and south, instead of north-east and south-west, in
order to reconcile his geography at all with the modern
maps. With these precautions some of the difficulty
of the situation disappears.</p>

<p>Colter, it is therefore assumed, followed the great
trail along the Absarokas to the Wind River Valley,
and crossed the divide by one of the easy passes at its
head. His two crossings of the Teton range were
along established trails. He evidently lost his bearings
somewhat in the vicinity of the Yellowstone
Lake, but as soon as he arrived at the river below the
lake he kept along the trail until he reached the important
crossing at Tower Falls. If he was in company
with Indians who had ever been through that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
country before, he learned that it would be no advantage
to cross at Mud Geyser, inasmuch as he would
strike the great Bannock Trail at the next ford below.
Moreover, the distance below the lake to the point
where Colter touched the Yellowstone is clearly
greater than that to the Mud Geyser Ford. The
bend in the river at the Great Falls, and the close
proximity of the Washburn Range to the river, are
distinctly indicated. The locality noted on the map
as &ldquo;Hot Springs Brimstone&rdquo; is evidently not that
near the Mud Geyser, as generally assumed, but instead,
that of the now world-renowned Mammoth
Hot Springs. As will be seen from the map, it is
nearer the Gallatin River than it is to the Yellowstone
<i>where Colter crossed</i>. If Colter visited the Springs
from Tower Falls, as is not unlikely, a clue is supplied
to the otherwise perplexing reference to the
Gallatin River in the above extract from the <i>Missouri
Gazette</i>, for it would thus appear that he was near the
sources of both the Grosse Corne and of the Gallatin.</p>

<p>The essential difficulties in the way of this theory
(and they exist with any possible theory that can be
advanced) are the following: (1.) There is no stream
on the map that can stand for the Snake River either
above or below Jackson Lake, although Colter must
have crossed it in each place. &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s River&rdquo;
comes nearest the first location, and may possibly be
intended to represent that stream; but Clark&rsquo;s evident
purpose to drain Jackson Lake into the Bighorn
River doubtless led to a distortion of the map in this
locality. (2.) The erroneous shape given to the Yellowstone
Lake will be readily understood by any one
who has visited its western shore. The jutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
promontories to the eastward entirely conceal from
view the great body of the lake and give it a form
not unlike that upon Clark&rsquo;s map. (3.) The absence
of the Great Falls from the map is not easily accounted
for, although the location and trend of the
Grand Cañon are shown with remarkable accuracy.
(4.) The absence of the many hot springs districts,
through which Colter passed, particularly that at the
west end of the Yellowstone Lake, may be explained
by the same spirit of incredulity which led to the
rejection of all similar accounts for a period of more
than sixty years. It is probable that Clark was not
willing to recognize Colter&rsquo;s statements on this subject
further than to note on his map the location of
the most wonderful of the hot springs groups mentioned
by him.</p>

<p>The direction in which Colter traveled is a matter
of no essential importance, and that here adopted is
based solely upon the consideration that the doubling
of the trail upon itself between Clark&rsquo;s Fork and the
Stinkingwater River, and the erratic course of the
route around Yellowstone Lake, can not be well accounted
for on the contrary hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> In
adopting, as Colter&rsquo;s point of crossing the Yellowstone,
the ford at Tower Creek, the author has followed the Hon. N. P.
Langford, in his reprint of Folsom&rsquo;s &ldquo;Valley of the Upper Yellowstone.&rdquo;
(See <a href="#bibl_119">Appendix E</a>.) All other writers who have
touched upon the subject have assumed the ford to be that near
the Mud Geyser.</p></div>

<p>Such, in the main, is &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s route in 1807.&rdquo;
That he was the discoverer of Yellowstone Lake, and
the foremost herald of the strange phenomena of that
region, may be accepted as beyond question. He did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
not, as is generally supposed, see the Firehole Geyser
Basins. But he saw too much for his reputation as a
man of veracity. No author or map-maker would
jeopardize the success of his work by incorporating
in it such incredible material as Colter furnished.
His stories were not believed; their author became
the subject of jest and ridicule; and the region of
his adventures was long derisively known as &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s
Hell.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_N_14" id="Footnote_N_14"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_N_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> This
name early came to be restricted to the locality where
Colter discovered the tar spring on the Stinkingwater, probably
because few trappers ever saw the other similar localities visited
by him. But Colter&rsquo;s descriptions, so well summed up by Irving in
his &ldquo;Captain Bonneville,&rdquo; undoubtedly refer in large part to what
he saw in the Yellowstone and Snake River Valleys.</p></div>

<p>The story of Colter&rsquo;s subsequent experience before
he returned to St. Louis is thrilling in the extreme.
Although it has no direct bearing upon this narrative,
still, since it is part of the biography of the discoverer
of the Upper Yellowstone, it can not be omitted. The
detailed account we owe to the naturalist Bradbury,
already referred to. He saw Colter above St. Louis
in the spring of 1811, one year after his return from
the mountains, and received the story directly from
him. All other accounts are variations from Bradbury.
Irving, who has made this story an Indian
classic, borrows it <i>in toto</i>. Perhaps in all the records
of Indian adventure there is not another instance of
such a miraculous escape, in which the details are
throughout so clearly within the range of possibility.
It is a consistent narrative from beginning to end. In
briefest outline it is as follows:</p>

<p>When Colter returned from his expedition of 1807,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he found Manuel Lisa, of the Missouri Fur Company,
already in the country, where he had just arrived
from St. Louis. With him was one Potts, believed to
be the same person who had been a private in the
party of Lewis and Clark. In the spring of 1808,
Colter and his old companion in arms set out to the
headwaters of the Missouri on a trapping expedition.
It was on a branch of Jefferson Fork that they went
to work, and here they met with their disastrous experience.</p>

<p>One morning while they were in a canoe examining
their traps they were surprised by a large party of
Blackfeet Indians. Potts attempted resistance and
was slain on the spot. Colter, with more presence of
mind, gave himself up as the only possible chance of
avoiding immediate death. The Indians then consulted
as to how they should kill him in order to yield
themselves the greatest amount of amusement. Colter,
upon being questioned as to his fleetness of foot,
sagaciously replied that he was a poor runner (though
in fact very swift), and the Indians, believing that it
would be a safe experiment, decided that he should
run for his life. Accordingly he was stripped naked
and was led by the chief to a point three or four hundred
yards in advance of the main body of the Indians.
Here he was told &ldquo;<i>to save himself if he could</i>,&rdquo; and the
race began&mdash;one man against five hundred.</p>

<p>The Indians quickly saw how they had been outwitted,
for Colter flew away from them as if upon the
wings of the wind. But his speed cost him dear.
The exertion caused the blood to stream from his
mouth and nostrils, and run down over his naked
form. The prickly pear and the rough ground lacerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his feet. Six miles away across a level plain was
a fringe of cottonwood on the banks of the Jefferson
River. Short of that lay not a shadow of chance of
concealment. It was a long race, but life hung upon
the issue. The Indians had not counted on such prodigious
running. Gradually they fell off, and when
Colter ventured for the first time to glance back, only
a small number were in his wake. Encouragement
was now added to hope, and he ran even faster than
before.</p>

<p>But there was one Indian who was too much for
him. He was steadily shortening the distance between
them, and at last had arrived within a spear&rsquo;s throw.
Was Colter to be slain by a single Indian after having
distanced five hundred? He would see. Suddenly
whirling about, he confronted the Indian, who was
astounded at the sudden move and at Colter&rsquo;s bloody
appearance. He tried to hurl his spear but stumbled
and broke it as he fell. Colter seized the pointed portion
and pinned the Indian to the earth.</p>

<p>Again he resumed his flight. He reached the Jefferson,
and discovered, some distance below, a raft of
driftwood against the head of an island. He dived
under this raft and found a place where he could get
his head above water. There, in painful suspense, he
awaited developments. The Indians explored the
island and examined the raft, but Colter&rsquo;s audacious
spirit was beyond their comprehension. It did not
occur to them that he was all the time surveying their
movements from his hiding place under the timber,
and they finally abandoned the search and withdrew.
Colter had saved himself. When evening came he
swam several miles down the river and then went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
ashore. For seven days he wandered naked and unarmed,
over stones, cacti, and the prickly pear,
scorched by the heat of noon and chilled by the frost
of night, finding his sole subsistence in such roots as
he might dig, until at last he reached Lisa&rsquo;s trading
post on the Bighorn River.</p>

<p>Even this terrible adventure could not dismay the
dauntless Colter, and he remained still another year
in the mountains. Finally, in the spring of 1810, he
got into a canoe and dropped down the river, &ldquo;three
thousand miles in thirty days,&rdquo; reaching St. Louis,
May 1st, after an absence of six years.</p>

<p>Colter remained in St. Louis for a time giving
Clark what information he could concerning the
places he had seen, and evidently talking a great deal
about his adventures. Finally he retired to the country
some distance up the Missouri, and married. Here
we again catch a glimpse of him when the Astorians
were on their way up the river. As Colter saw the
well appointed expedition setting out for the mountains,
the old fever seized him again and he was upon
the point of joining the party. But what the hardships
of the wilderness and the pleasures of civilization
could not dissuade him from doing, the charms
of a newly-married wife easily accomplished. Colter
remained behind; and here the curtain of oblivion
falls upon the discoverer of the Yellowstone. It is
not without genuine satisfaction that, having followed
him through the incredible mazes of &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell,&rdquo;
we bid him adieu amid surroundings of so different a
character.</p>

<p class="caption2">THE TRADER AND TRAPPER.</p>


<p>For sixty years after Lewis and Clark returned
from their expedition, the headwaters of the Yellowstone
remained unexplored except by the trader and
trapper. The traffic in peltries it was that first induced
extensive exploration of the west. Concerning
the precious metals, the people seem to have had
little faith in their abundant existence in the west,
and no organized search for them was made in the
earlier years of the century. But that country, even
in its unsettled state, had other and important sources
of wealth. Myriads of beaver inhabited the streams
and innumerable buffalo roamed the valleys. The
buffalo furnished the trapper with means of subsistence,
and beaver furs were better than mines of gold.
Far in advance of the tide of settlement the lonely
trapper, and after him the trader, penetrated the unknown
west. Gradually the enterprise of individuals
crystallized around a few important nuclei and there
grew up those great fur-trading companies which for
many years exercised a kind of paternal sway over the
Indians and the scarcely more civilized trappers. A
brief resumé of the history of these companies will
show how important a place they occupy in the early
history of the Upper Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The climax of the western fur business may be
placed at about the year 1830. At that time three
great companies operated in territories whose converging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
lines of separation centered in the region about
Yellowstone Lake. The oldest and most important of
them, and the one destined to outlive the others, was
the world-renowned Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. It was
at that time more than a century and a half old. Its
earlier history was in marked contrast with that of
later years. Secure in the monopoly which its extensive
charter rights guaranteed, it had been content
with substantial profits and had never pushed its business
far into new territory nor managed it with aggressive
vigor. It was not until forced to action by
the encroachments of a dangerous rival, that it became
the prodigious power of later times.</p>

<p>This rival was the great North-west Fur Company
of Montreal: It had grown up since the French and
Indian War, partly as a result of that conflict, and
finally took corporate form in 1787. It had none of
the important territorial rights of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company, but its lack of monopoly was more than
made up by the enterprise of its promoters. With its
bands of Canadian frontiersmen, it boldly penetrated
the north-west and paid little respect to those territorial
rights which its venerable rival was powerless
to enforce. It rapidly extended its operations far into
the unexplored interior. Lewis and Clark found its
traders among the Mandans in 1804. In 1811 the
Astorians saw its first party descend the Columbia to
the sea. Two years later the American traders on the
Pacific Coast were forced to succumb to their British
rivals.</p>

<p>A long and bitter strife now ensued between the
two British companies. It even assumed the magnitude
of civil war, and finally resulted in a frightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
massacre of unoffending colonists. The British government
interfered and forced the rivals into court,
where they were brought to the verge of ruin by protracted
litigation. A compromise was at last effected
in 1821 by an amalgamation of the two companies
under the name of the older rival.</p>

<p>But in the meantime a large part of their best fur
country had been lost. In 1815 the government of
the United States excluded British traders from its
territory east of the Rocky Mountains. To the west
of this limit, however, the amalgamated company
easily forced all its rivals from the field. No American
fur company ever attained the splendid organization,
nor the influence over the Indians, possessed by
the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. At the time of which
we write it was master of the trade in the Columbia
River valley, and the eastern limit of its operations
within the territory of the United States was nearly
coincident with the present western boundary of the
Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>The second of the great companies to which reference
has been made was the American Fur Company.
It was the final outcome of John Jacob Astor&rsquo;s various
attempts to control the fur trade of the United States.
Although it was incorporated in 1809, it was for a
time overshadowed by the more brilliant enterprises
known as the Pacific Fur Company and the Southwest
Fur Company. The history of Mr. Astor&rsquo;s
Pacific Fur Company, the dismal experiences of the
Astorians, and the deplorable failure of the whole undertaking,
are matters familiar to all readers of
Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Astoria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other project gave for a time more substantial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
promise of success. A British company of
considerable importance, under the name of the
Mackinaw Company, with headquarters at Michilimacinac,
had for some time operated in the country
about the headwaters of the Mississippi now included
in the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Astor succeeded
in forming a new company, partly with
American and partly with Canadian capital. This
company bought out the Mackinaw Company, and
changed the name to South-west Fur Company. But
scarcely had its promising career begun when it was
cut short by the War of 1812.</p>

<p>The failure of these two attempts caused Mr. Astor
to turn to the old American Fur Company. The exclusion
Act of 1815 enabled him to buy at his own
price the North-west Fur Company&rsquo;s posts on the upper
rivers, and the American Company rapidly extended
its trade over all the country, from Lake
Superior to the Rocky Mountains. Its posts multiplied
in every direction, and at an early date steamboats
began to do its business up the Missouri River
from St. Louis. It gradually absorbed lesser concerns,
such as the Missouri Fur Company, and the Columbia
Fur Company, and in 1823 was reorganized under the
name of The North American Fur Company. In
1834, Astor sold his interests to Chouteau, Valle and
Company, of St. Louis, and retired from the business.
At this time the general western limit of the territory
operated in by this formidable company was the
northern and eastern slope of the mountains which
bound the Yellowstone Park on the north and east.
Its line of operations was down the river to St. Louis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and its great trading posts were located at frequent
intervals between.</p>

<p>The third of the great rival companies was the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, which originated in
St. Louis in 1822, and received its full organization in
1826 under the direction of Jedediah Smith, David
Jackson and William Sublette. Among the leading
spirits, who at one time or another guided its affairs,
was the famous mountaineer James Bridger to whom
frequent reference will be made.</p>

<p>This company had its general center of operations
on the head waters of Green River to the west of
South Pass. Unlike the other companies, it had no
navigable stream along which it could establish posts
and conduct its operations. By the necessities of its
exclusively mountain trade it developed a new feature
of the fur business. The <i>voyageur</i>, with his canoe and
oar, gave way to the mountaineer, with his saddle and
rifle. The trading post was replaced by the annual
rendezvous, which was in many points the forerunner
of the later cattle &ldquo;roundups&rdquo; of the plains. These
rendezvous were agreed upon each year at localities
best suited for the convenience of the trade. Hither
in the spring came from the east convoys of supplies
for the season&rsquo;s use. Hither repaired also the various
parties of hunters and trappers and such bands of Indians
as roamed in the vicinity. These meetings were
great occasions, both in the transaction of business
and in the round of festivities that always prevailed.
After the traffic of the occasion was over, and the
plans for the ensuing year were agreed upon, the convoys
returned to the States and the trappers to their
retreats in the mountains. The field of operations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
this company was very extensive and included about
all of the West not controlled by the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
and American Fur Companies.</p>

<p>Thus was the territory of the great West practically
parceled out among these three
companies.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> It must
not be supposed that there was any agreement, tacit
or open, that each company should keep within certain
limits. There were, indeed, a few temporary arrangements
of this sort, but for the most part each
company maintained the right to work in any territory
it saw fit, and there was constant invasion by each
of the proper territories of the other. But the practical
necessities of the business kept them, broadly
speaking, within the limits which we have noted. The
roving bands of &ldquo;free trappers&rdquo; and &ldquo;lone traders,&rdquo;
and individual expeditions like those of Captain
Bonneville and Nathaniel J. Wyeth, acknowledged
allegiance to none of the great organizations, but
wandered where they chose, dealing by turns with
each of the companies.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_O_15" id="Footnote_O_15"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_O_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> A
singular and striking coincidence at once discloses itself to
any one who compares maps showing the territories operated in
by these three companies, and those which belonged to the three
great families of Indians mentioned in a preceding chapter. By
far the larger part of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s territory, as
far west as the main range of the Rocky Mountains, was Algonquian.
The American Fur Company&rsquo;s territory was almost entirely
Siouan, and that of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company,
Shoshonean.</p></div>

<p>Nor did any company maintain an exclusive monopoly
of its peculiar methods of conducting business.
The American Fur Company frequently held rendezvous
at points remote from its trading posts; and the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company in later years resorted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to the Missouri River as its line of supplies. In fact,
the interests of the two companies finally became to
such an extent dependent upon each other that a
union was effected, in 1839, under the firm name of P.
Chouteau, Jr.</p>

<p>The records of those early days abound in references
to the fierce competition in trade which existed
between these great organizations. It led to every
manner of device or subterfuge which might deceive
a rival as to routes, conceal from him important trapping
grounds, undermine the loyalty of his employes
or excite the hostility of the Indians against him. It
often led to deeds of violence, and made the presence
of a rival band of trappers more dreaded than a war
party of the implacable Blackfeet.</p>

<p>The vigor and enterprise of these traders caused
their business to penetrate the remotest and most inaccessible
corners of the land. Silliman&rsquo;s Journal for
January, 1834, declares that&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mountains and forests, from the Arctic Sea
to the Gulf of Mexico, are threaded through every
maze by the hunter. Every river and tributary
stream, from the Columbia to the Rio del Norte, and
from the Mackenzie to the Colorado of the West,
from their head waters to their junctions, are searched
and trapped for beaver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That a business of such all-pervading character
should have left a region like our present Yellowstone
Park unexplored would seem extremely doubtful.
That region lay, a sort of neutral ground, between
the territories of the rival fur companies. Its streams
abounded with beaver; and, although hemmed in by
vast mountains, and snow-bound most of the year, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
could not have escaped discovery. In fact, every
part of it was repeatedly visited by trappers. Rendezvous
were held on every side of it, and once, it is
believed, in Hayden Valley, just north of Yellowstone
Lake. Had the fur business been more enduring, the
geyser regions would have become known at least a
generation sooner.</p>

<p>But a business carried on with such relentless vigor
naturally soon taxed the resources of nature beyond
its capacity for reproduction. In regions under the
control of a single organization, as in the vast domains
of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, great care was
taken to preserve the fur-bearing animals from extinction;
but in United States territory, the exigencies
of competition made any such provision impossible.
The poor beaver, as at a later day the buffalo, quickly
succumbed to his ubiquitous enemies. There was no
spot remote enough for him to build his dam in peace,
and the once innumerable multitude speedily dwindled
away. The few years immediately preceding and following
1830 were the halcyon days of the fur trade in
the United States. Thenceforward it rapidly declined,
and by 1850 had shrunk to a mere shadow of
its former greatness. With its disappearance the
early knowledge of the Upper Yellowstone also disappeared.
Subsequent events&mdash;the Mormon emigration,
the war with Mexico, and the discovery of
gold&mdash;drew attention, both private and official, in
other directions; and the great wonderland became
again almost as much unknown as in the days of
Lewis and Clark.</p>

<p class="caption2">EARLY KNOWLEDGE OF THE YELLOWSTONE.</p>


<p>On the west bank of the Yellowstone River, a
quarter of a mile above the Upper Falls, in a ravine
now crossed by a lofty wooden bridge, stands a pine
tree, on which is the oldest record, except that of
Colter, of the presence of white men within the present
limits of the Park. It is an inscription, giving
the initials of a name and the date when inscribed.
It was discovered in 1880 by Col. P. W. Norris, then
Superintendent of the Park. It is now practically illegible
from overgrowth, although some of the characters
can still be made out. Col. Norris, who saw it
fifteen years ago, claims to have successfully deciphered
it. He verified the date by counting the annual rings
on another tree near by, which bore hatchet marks,
presumably of the same date. The time that had
elapsed since these cuts were made corresponded well
with the inscribed date. The inscription was:</p>

<p>
J O R<br />
Aug 19 1819<br />
</p>

<p>Efforts have been made to trace this inscription to
some of the early noted trappers, but the attempt can
hardly succeed. Even if an identity of initials were
established, the identity of individuals would still remain
in doubt. Nothing short of some authentic
record of such a visit as must have taken place can
satisfy the requirements of the case. In the absence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of any such record, the most that can be said is that
the inscription is proof positive that the Park country
was visited by white men, after Colter&rsquo;s time, fully
fifty years before its final discovery.</p>

<p>Col. Norris' researches disclosed other similar evidence,
although in no other instance with so plain a
clue as to date. Near Beaver Lake and Obsidian
Cliff, he found, in 1878, a cache of marten traps of an
old pattern used by the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s
trappers fifty years before. He also examined the
ruins of an ancient block-house discovered by Frederick
Bottler at the base of Mt. Washburn, near the
Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone. Its decayed condition
indicated great age. In other places, the
stumps of trees, old logs used to cross streams, and
many similar proofs, were brought to light by that inveterate
ranger of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Washburn party, in 1870, discovered on the
east bank of the Yellowstone, just above Mud Geyser,
the remains of a pit, probably once used for concealment
in shooting water fowl.</p>

<p>In 1882, there was still living in Montana, at the
advanced age of one hundred and two years, a Frenchman
by the name of Baptiste Ducharne. This man
spent the summers of 1824 and 1826 on the Upper
Yellowstone River trapping for beaver. He saw the
Grand Cañon and Falls of the Yellowstone and the
Yellowstone Lake. He passed through the geyser
regions, and could accurately describe them more than
half a century after he had seen them.</p>

<p>A book called &ldquo;The River of the
West,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in 1871, but copyrighted in 1869, before the publication
of any modern account of the geyser regions,
contains the record of an adventure in the Yellowstone
three years after those of Ducharne. The book
is a biography of one Joseph Meek, a trapper and
pioneer of considerable note. The adventure to which
reference is made took place in 1829, and was the result
of a decision by the Rocky Mountain Fur Company
to retire from competition with the Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay Company in the Snake River Valley. In leaving
the country, Captain William Sublette, the chief
partner, led his party up Henry Fork, across the
Madison and Gallatin Rivers, to the high ridge overlooking
the Yellowstone, at some point near the present
Cinnabar Mountain. Here the party was dispersed
by a band of Blackfeet, and Meek, one of its members,
became separated from his companions. He had
lost his horse and most of his equipment and in this
condition he wandered for several days, without food
or shelter, until he was found by two of his companions.
His route lay in a southerly direction, to the
eastward of the Yellowstone, at some distance back
from the river. On the morning of the fifth day he
had the following experience:</p>

<p>"Being desirous to learn something of the progress
he had made, he ascended a low mountain in the
neighborhood of his camp, and behold! the whole
country beyond was smoking with vapor from boiling
springs, and burning with gases issuing from small
craters, each of which was emitting a sharp, whistling
sound. When the first surprise of this astonishing
scene had passed, Joe began to admire its effect from
an artistic point of view. The morning being clear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with a sharp frost, he thought himself reminded of
the City of Pittsburg, as he had beheld it on a winter
morning, a couple of years before. This, however,
related only to the rising smoke and vapor; for the
extent of the volcanic region was immense, reaching
far out of sight. The general face of the country was
smooth and rolling, being a level plain, dotted with
cone-shaped mounds. On the summit of these mounds
were small craters from four to eight feet in diameter.
Interspersed among these on the level plain were
larger craters, some of them from four to six miles
across. Out of these craters, issued blue flames and
molten brimstone."<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a>

<p>Making some allowance for the trapper&rsquo;s tendency
to exaggeration, we recognize in this description the
familiar picture of the hot springs districts. The precise
location is difficult to determine; but Meek&rsquo;s
previous wanderings, and the subsequent route of
himself and his companions whom he met here, show
conclusively that it was one of the numerous districts
east of the Yellowstone, which were possibly then
more active than now.</p>

<p>This book affords much other evidence of early
knowledge of the country immediately bordering the
present Park. The Great Bend of the Yellowstone
where Livingston now stands, was already a famous
rendezvous. The Gardiner and Firehole Rivers were
well known to trappers; and a much-used trail led
from the Madison across the Gallatin Range to the
Gardiner, and thence up the Yellowstone and East
Fork across the mountains to the Bighorn Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>In Vol. I, No. 17, August 13, 1842, of <i>The Wasp</i>, a
Mormon paper published at Nauvoo, Ill., occurs the
first, as it is by far the best, of all early accounts of the
geyser regions prior to 1870. It is an extract from an
unpublished work, entitled <i>Life in the Rocky Mountains</i>.
Who was the author will probably never be
known; but that he was a man of culture and education,
altogether beyond the average trader, is evident
from the passing glimpse which we have of his work.
He apparently made his visit from some point in the
valley of Henry Fork not far west of the Firehole
River, for, at the utmost allowance, he traveled only
about sixty or seventy miles to reach the geyser
basins. The evidence is conclusive that the scene of
this visit was the Upper Geyser Basin. It fits perfectly
with the description, while numerous insuperable
discrepancies render identification with the Lower
Basin, which some have sought to establish, impossible.
Following is this writer&rsquo;s narrative:</p>

<p>"I had heard in the summer of 1833, while at rendezvous,
that remarkable boiling springs had been discovered
on the sources of the Madison, by a party of
trappers, in their spring hunt; of which the accounts
they gave, were so very astonishing, that I determined
to examine them myself, before recording their description,
though I had the united testimony of more
than twenty men on the subject, who all declared they
saw them, and that they really were as extensive and
remarkable as they had been described. Having now an
opportunity of paying them a visit, and as another or
a better might not occur, I parted with the company
after supper, and taking with me two Pend d&rsquo;Oreilles
(who were induced to take the excursion with me, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the promise of an extra present,) set out at a round
pace, the night being clear and comfortable. We proceeded
over the plain about twenty miles, and halted
until daylight, on a fine spring, flowing into Camas
Creek. Refreshed by a few hours' sleep, we started
again after a hasty breakfast, and entered a very extensive
forest, called the Pine Woods; (a continued
succession of low mountains or hills, entirely covered
with a dense growth of this species of timber;)
which we passed through and reached the vicinity of
the springs about dark, having seen several lakes or
ponds on the sources of the Madison, and rode about
forty miles; which was a hard day&rsquo;s ride, taking into
consideration the rough irregularity of the country
through which we traveled.</p>

<p>"We regaled ourselves with a cup of coffee, the materials
for making which we had brought with us, and
immediately after supper, lay down to rest, sleepy and
much fatigued. The continual roaring of the springs,
however, (which was distinctly heard,) for some time
prevented my going to sleep, and excited an impatient
curiosity to examine them, which I was obliged to defer
the gratification of until morning, and filled my
slumbers with visions of waterspouts, cataracts, fountains,
<i>jets d&rsquo;eau</i> of immense dimensions, etc., etc.</p>

<p>"When I arose in the morning, clouds of vapor
seemed like a dense fog to overhang the springs, from
which frequent reports or explosions of different loudness,
constantly assailed our ears. I immediately proceeded
to inspect them, and might have exclaimed with
the Queen of Sheba, when their full reality of dimensions
and novelty burst upon my view, &lsquo;the half was
not told me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"From the surface of a rocky plain or table, burst
forth columns of water, of various dimensions, projecting
high in the air, accompanied by loud explosions,
and sulphurous vapors, which were highly disagreeable
to the smell. The rock from which these
springs burst forth was calcareous, and probably extends
some distance from them, beneath the soil. The
largest of these beautiful fountains projects a column
of boiling water several feet in diameter, to the height
of more than one hundred and fifty feet, in my opinion;
but the party of Alvarez, who discovered it, persist
in declaring that it could not be less than four
times that distance in height&mdash;accompanied with a
tremendous noise. These explosions and discharges
occur at intervals of about two hours. After having
witnessed three of them, I ventured near enough, to
put my hand into the waters of its basin, but withdrew
it instantly, for the heat of the water in this
immense cauldron was altogether too great for my
comfort; and the agitation of the water, the disagreeable
effluvium continually exuding, and the hollow
unearthly rumbling under the rock on which I stood,
so ill accorded with my notions of personal safety,
that I retreated back precipitately to a respectful distance.
The Indians, who were with me, were quite
appalled, and could not by any means be induced to
approach them. They seemed astonished at my presumption
in advancing up to the large one, and when
I safely returned, congratulated me upon my &lsquo;narrow
escape.&rsquo; They believed them to be supernatural
and supposed them to be the production of the Evil
Spirit. One of them remarked that hell, of which
he had heard from the whites, must be in that vicinity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The diameter of the basin into which the waters
of the largest jet principally fall, and from the center
of which, through a hole in the rock, of about nine
or ten feet in diameter, the water spouts up as above
related, may be about thirty feet. There are many
other smaller fountains, that did not throw their waters
up so high, but occurred at shorter intervals. In
some instances the volumes were projected obliquely
upward, and fell into the neighboring fountains, or
on the rock or prairie. But their ascent was generally
perpendicular, falling in and about their own basins
or apertures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These wonderful productions of nature are situated
near the center of a small valley, surrounded by
pine-covered hills, through which a small fork of the
Madison flows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here we have a description, as from the pen of some
earlier Doane or Langford, free from exaggeration and
true to the facts. No one who has seen the Upper
Geyser Basin will question its general correctness.
The writer then goes on to relate what he has learned
from others, but here exaggeration creeps in and this
part of his narrative is less reliable. It continues:</p>

<p>"From several trappers who had recently returned
from the Yellow Stone, I received an account of boiling
springs that differ from those seen on Salt River
only in magnitude, being on a vastly larger scale;
some of their cones are from twenty to thirty feet
high, and forty to fifty paces in circumference. Those
which have ceased to emit boiling, vapor, etc., of
which there were several, are full of shelving cavities,
even some fathoms in extent, which give them, inside,
an appearance of honey-comb. The ground for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
several acres extent in vicinity of the springs is evidently
hollow, and constantly exhales a hot steam or
vapor of disagreeable odor, and a character entirely
to prevent vegetation. They are situated in the valley
at the head of that river near the lake, which constitutes
its source.</p>

<p>"A short distance from these springs, near the margin
of the lake, there is one quite different from any
yet described. It is of a circular form, several feet in
diameter, clear, cold and pure; the bottom appears
visible to the eye, and seems seven or eight feet below
the surface of the earth or water, without meeting
any resistance. &ldquo;What is most singular with respect
to this fountain is the fact that at regular intervals of
about two minutes, a body or column of water bursts
up to the height of eight feet, with an explosion
as loud as the report of a musket, and then falls back
into it; for a few seconds the water is roily, but it
speedily settles and becomes transparent as before the
effusion. A slight tremulous motion of the water,
and a low rumbling sound from the caverns beneath,
precede each explosion. This spring was believed to
be connected with the lake by some subterranean passage,
but the cause of its periodical eruptions or discharges,
is entirely unknown. I have never before
heard of a cold spring, whose waters exhibit the
phenomena of periodical explosive propulsion, in form
of a jet. The geysers of Iceland, and the various
other European springs, the waters of which are projected
upwards, with violence and uniformity, as well
as those seen on the head waters of the Madison, are
invariably hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cold water geyser above described, although,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
apparently a myth, may not have been so after all.
In many places along the west shore of the Yellowstone
Lake there are visible protuberances in the
water surface where boiling springs from beneath
force the cold water upward. It is quite possible that
this spring was so connected with the lake as to keep
constantly filled with cold water to a considerable
depth; and that the eruptive energy of the spring was
expended in lifting the superincumbent mass without
giving any visible indication of the thermal action
below.</p>

<p>The whole article forms the most interesting and
authentic reference to the geyser regions published
prior to 1870. It proves beyond question that a
knowledge of this region existed among the early
trappers, and confirms our previous deduction that the
wide range of the fur business could not have left it
unexplored.</p>

<p>In a letter addressed by General Bonneville to the
Montana Historical Society,<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> since the creation of the
Yellowstone Park, he states that, at the time of his
sojourn in the mountains, in 1831-4, the geyser regions
were known to his men, although he had not personally
seen them. He also remembered having seen the
trader Alvarez, referred to in the above article.</p>

<p>In 1844, a large party of trappers entered the Upper
Yellowstone Valley from the south, passed around
the west shore of the Yellowstone Lake to the outlet,
where they had a severe battle with the Blackfeet
Indians, in a broad open tract at that point. The remains
of their old corral were still visible as late as
1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>There are numerous other interesting, though less
definite, references to an early knowledge of the Yellowstone;
but those we have given show their general
character. The important fact to remember is that
this knowledge was barren of result. For the most
part it existed only in the minds of illiterate men, and
perished with them. It never caught the public ear
and did not in the least degree hasten the final discovery.
Historically interesting these early adventures
will always be; as are also the Norse voyages to
America; but they are very far from being the Columbus
voyage of discovery.</p>

<p class="caption2">JAMES BRIDGER.</p>


<p>Of the early characters whose names are closely
linked with the history of the Yellowstone, the most
distinguished is James Bridger, a sketch of whose life
is given in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>, under &ldquo;Bridger Lake.&rdquo;
That he had often been in the region of the Yellowstone
Park, and was familiar with its unique features,
is now well known. His first personal knowledge of
them is believed to date from 1824, when he is supposed
to have been upon the upper Yellowstone. It
is certain that before 1840 he knew of the existence
of the geysers in the Firehole Valley, although at that
time he had probably not seen them himself. Between
1841 and 1844 Bridger was leader of a grand
hunting and trapping expedition, which for upward
of two years, wandered over the country from the
Great Falls of the Missouri to Chihuahua, Mexico.
At some time during this expedition he entered the
region of the upper Yellowstone and saw most of its
wonders. His descriptions of the geysers and other
remarkable features of that locality can be traced
back nearly to this period and present an accuracy of
detail which could come only from personal observation.</p>

<p>Among the records of these descriptions the earliest
is that by Captain J. W. Gunnison, of the Corps of
Topographical Engineers, who was associated with
Captain Howard Stansbury, of the same corps, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Salt Lake Expedition of 1849-50. The record is
found in Gunnison&rsquo;s History of the
Mormons,<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> and
dates back to this expedition. It reads:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He [Bridger] gives a picture, most romantic and
enticing, of the head waters of the Yellow Stone. A
lake, sixty miles long, cold and pellucid, lies embosomed
among high precipitous mountains. On the
west side is a sloping plain, several miles wide, with
clumps of trees and groves of pine. The ground resounds
with the tread of horses. Geysers spout up
seventy feet high, with a terrific, hissing noise, at regular
intervals. Water-falls are sparkling, leaping and
thundering down the precipices, and collect in the
pool below. The river issues from this lake, and for
fifteen miles roars through the perpendicular cañon at
the outlet. In this section are the &lsquo;Great Springs,&rsquo;
so hot that meat is readily cooked in them, and as
they descend on the successive terraces, afford at
length delightful baths. On the other side is an acid
spring, which gushes out in a river torrent; and below
is a cave, which supplies &lsquo;vermillion&rsquo; for the
savages in abundance.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_S_19" id="Footnote_S_19"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_S_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Page 151,
Gunnison&rsquo;s History of the Mormons.
See <a href="#bibl_77">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>In this admirable summary we readily discover the
Yellowstone Lake, the Grand Cañon, the Falls, the
geyser basins, the Mammoth Hot Springs, and Cinnabar
Mountain. Prior to 1860, Bridger had related
these accounts to Captain Warren, Captain Raynolds,
Doctor Hayden, and others, and although he seems to
have convinced these gentlemen that there was something
in his stories, they still attributed less to fact
than to fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In his efforts to disseminate a knowledge of this region,
Bridger was as determined as Colter had been
before him, and with little better success. He tried to
have his narratives published, but no periodical would
lend itself to his service. The editor of the <i>Kansas
City Journal</i> stated editorially in 1879 that Bridger
had told him of these wonders fully thirty years before.
He prepared an article from Bridger&rsquo;s description,
but suppressed it because his friends ridiculed
the whole thing as incredible. He later publicly
apologized to Bridger, who was then living at Westport,
Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_T_20" id="Footnote_T_20"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_T_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> Of
interest in this connection is the following extract from a
recent letter to the writer by the present managing editor of the
<i>Kansas City Journal</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The interview had with Bridger was in the year 1856. He
told Col. R. T. Van Horn, Editor of the <i>Journal</i>, which was published
at that time, the story of the Park with the geysers, and at
the same time, drew with a piece of charcoal on a piece of wrapping
paper an outline of the route necessary to be taken by a
railroad should it ever cross the continent, which route is exactly
on the line that is now crossed by the Union Pacific.</p>

<p>In this conversation, he told the Colonel about the mud springs
and the other wonders of that part of the country, or to use his
own expression, &lsquo;it was a place where hell bubbled up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel was much interested in the matter at the time and
took notes of the account, but did not print it because a man who
claimed to know Bridger, told him that he would be laughed out
of town if he printed &lsquo;any of old Jim Bridger&rsquo;s lies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The persistent incredulity of his countrymen, and
their ill-concealed suspicion of his honesty, to say nothing
of his mental soundness, were long a cloud
upon Bridger&rsquo;s life; but, more fortunate than his prototype,
Colter, he lived to see himself triumphantly
vindicated. Whether from disgust at this unmerited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
treatment, or because of his love of a good story,
Bridger seems finally to have resolved that distrust of
his word, if it must exist, should at least have some
justification. He was in fact noted for &ldquo;drawing the
long bow to an unparalleled tension,&rdquo; and for never
permitting troublesome scruples of conscience to interfere
with the proper embellishment of his yarns.
These were generally based upon fact, and diligent
search will discover in them the &ldquo;soul of truth&rdquo; which,
according to Herbert Spencer, always exists &ldquo;in things
erroneous.&rdquo; These anecdotes are current even yet
among the inhabitants of the Yellowstone, and the
tourist who remains long in the Park will not fail to
hear them.</p>

<p>When Bridger found that he could not make his
hearers believe in the existence of a vast mass of volcanic
glass, now known to all tourists as the interesting
Obsidian Cliff, he supplied them with another
glass mountain of a truly original sort. Its discovery
was the result of one of his hunting trips and it happened
in this wise.</p>

<p>Coming one day in sight of a magnificent elk, he
took careful aim at the unsuspecting animal and fired.
To his great amazement, the elk not only was not
wounded, but seemed not even to have heard the report
of the rifle. Bridger drew considerably nearer
and gave the elk the benefit of his most deliberate
aim; but with the same result as before. A third and
a fourth effort met with a similar fate. Utterly exasperated,
he seized his rifle by the barrel, resolved to
use it as a club since it had failed as a firearm. He
rushed madly toward the elk, but suddenly crashed
into an immovable vertical wall which proved to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
mountain of perfectly transparent glass, on the farther
side of which, still in peaceful security, the elk was
quietly grazing. Stranger still, the mountain was not
only of pure glass, but was a perfect telescopic lens,
and, whereas, the elk seemed but a few hundred yards
off, it was in reality twenty-five miles away!</p>

<p>Another of Bridger&rsquo;s discoveries was an ice-cold
spring near the summit of a lofty mountain, the
water from which flowed down over a long smooth
slope, where it acquired such a velocity that it was
boiling hot when it reached the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> This
story, which is taken from the report of Captain W. F.
Raynolds, was one of Bridger&rsquo;s favorites, and it is even said that
he did not regard it as pleasantry at all, but as plain matter of
fact. Mr. Langford, who often heard him relate it, says that he
generally described the stream as flowing over the smooth surface
of a rock, and reasoned that, as two sticks rubbed together produce
heat by friction, so the water rubbing over the rock became
hot. In proof, he cited an instance where the water was hot only
in close proximity to the rock and not at the surface. Mr. Langford
found a partial confirmation of the fact, but not of the theory,
in fording the Firehole River in 1870. He passed over the
smooth deposit of an active hot spring in the bed of the stream,
and found that the stream bottom and the water in contact with
it were hot.</p></div>

<p>An account, in which the &ldquo;soul of truth&rdquo; is not so
readily apparent, is that of a mining prospector of
this region, who, in later times, met a unique and horrible
fate. He had for days been traveling with a
party toward a prodigious diamond set in the top of a
mountain, where, even at noonday, it shone with a luster
surpassing the sun. He arrived at length on the top
of the mountain only to see the diamond on another
summit apparently as far away as ever. Disheartened
and weary, he thought to save the labor of descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by taking advantage of an extremely smooth face of
the mountain, and accordingly sat down upon his
shovel, as upon a toboggan, and let slide. There was a
vacant place around the camp-fire that evening, and
next day the rest of the party, passing along the base
of the mountain, found an infusible clay pipe and the
molten remains of a shovel. Warned by the fate of
their comrade, the superstitious survivors forbore any
further search for the diamond.</p>

<p>To those who have visited the west shore of the Yellowstone
Lake, and know how simple a matter it is to
catch the lake trout and cook them in the boiling
pools without taking them from the line, the ground
work of the following description will be obvious
enough. Somewhere along the shore an immense boiling
spring discharges its overflow directly into the lake.
The specific gravity of the water is less than that of
the lake, owing probably to the expansive action of
heat, and it floats in a stratum three or four feet thick
upon the cold water underneath. When Bridger was
in need of fish it was to this place that he went.
Through the hot upper stratum he let fall his bait to
the subjacent habitable zone, and having hooked his
victim, cooked him <i>on the way out</i>!</p>

<p>In like manner the visitor to the region of petrifactions
on Specimen Ridge in the north-east corner of
the Park, and to various points in the hot springs districts,
will have no difficulty in discovering the base
material out of which Bridger contrived the following
picturesque yarn. According to his account there
exists in the Park country a mountain which was
once cursed by a great medicine man of the Crow nation.
Every thing upon the mountain at the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
this dire event became instantly petrified and has remained
so ever since. All forms of life are standing
about in stone where they were suddenly caught by
the petrifying influences, even as the inhabitants of
ancient Pompeii were surprised by the ashes of Vesuvius.
Sage brush, grass, prairie fowl, antelope, elk,
and bears may there be seen as perfect as in actual life.
Even flowers are blooming in colors of crystal, and
birds soar with wings spread in motionless flight, while
the air floats with music and perfumes siliceous, and
the sun and the moon shine with petrified light!</p>

<p>In this way Bridger avenged himself for the spirit
of distrust so often shown for what he had related.
The time presently came, however, when the public
learned, not only how large a measure of truth there
was in his stories, but also how ingenious a tale he
could weave from very inadequate material.</p>

<p class="caption2">RAYNOLDS' EXPEDITION.</p>


<p>On the 13th of April, 1859, Captain W. F. Raynolds,
of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, U. S. A., was
ordered to explore &ldquo;the region of country through
which flow the principal tributaries of the Yellowstone
River, and the mountains in which they, and the
Gallatin and Madison Forks of the Missouri, have
their source.&rdquo; This was the first government
expedition<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>
directed to the precise locality which is now embraced
in the Yellowstone National Park. It is interesting
to us, not for what it accomplished&mdash;for it fortunately
failed to penetrate the Upper Yellowstone
country&mdash;but because it gives an admirable <i>resumé</i>,
in the form of a report and a map, of the geographical
knowledge of that country down to the date of actual
discovery.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_V_22" id="Footnote_V_22"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_V_22"><span class="label">[V]</span></a> Accompanying
this expedition as geologist was Dr. F. V. Hayden,
whose name is so intimately connected with the history of
the Yellowstone Park. James Bridger was guide to the party.</p></div>

<p>Captain Raynolds was in the field during the two
seasons of 1859 and 1860; but it was only in the summer
of 1860 that he directed his efforts toward the
country in which we are particularly interested. In
May of that year the expedition left its winter quarters
at Deer Creek, Wyo., and marched to the junction
of the Wind River and the Popo Agie where these
streams unite under the name of Bighorn River. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the party divided. One division under Captain Raynolds
was to ascend the Wind River to its source and
then cross to the head waters of the Yellowstone. This
stream they were to follow down to the Great Bend,
and then cross over to the Three Forks of the Missouri.
The other party, under Lieutenant Maynadier,
was to skirt the east and north flanks of the Absaroka
Range and to join the first party at the Three Forks,
if possible, not later than July 1st.</p>

<p>Captain Raynolds was charged with other instructions
than those mentioned in his order, which must be
kept in mind in order properly to account for the final
outcome of the expedition. A total eclipse of the
sun was to occur on July 18th of that year, and its
line of greatest occultation lay north of the British
boundary. It was desired that Captain Raynolds
should be present in that locality in time to observe
the eclipse. This condition, rather than impassable
mountains or unmelted snows, was the chief obstacle
to a thorough exploration of the Upper Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The two parties separated May 24th. Captain Raynolds,
according to his programme, kept up the Wind
River valley, and with much difficulty effected a crossing
by way of Union Pass&mdash;which he named&mdash;to the
western slope of the mountains. He then turned north
seeking a passage to the head waters of the Yellowstone.
When nearly opposite Two-Ocean Pass, he
made a strenuous effort to force his way through,
spending two days in the attempt. But it was still
June and the snow lay deep on the mountains. It
was a physical impossibility to get through at that
point, and the risk of missing the eclipse forebade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
efforts elsewhere. The Captain was deeply disappointed
at this result. He writes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fondly cherished schemes of this nature were
all dissipated by the prospect before us; &#8230; and
I therefore very reluctantly decided to abandon the
plan to which I had so steadily clung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems not a little singular that so experienced a
guide as Bridger should not have conducted the party
up the valley of the Snake River and thence over the
low divide between that stream and the Yellowstone
Lake&mdash;a route which was perfectly practicable even as
early as June. But the plan does not appear to have
been entertained, and the expedition passed around
the Park region to the west, arriving at the Three
Forks on the 29th of June.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maynadier wisely made no attempt to
cross the Absaroka Range, which rose continuously
on his left. Had he done so, the deep snow at that
season would have rendered his efforts futile. He
kept close to the flank of the mountains until he
reached the valley of the Yellowstone north of the
Park, and then hastened to join his commanding
officer at the appointed rendezvous. He reached the
Three Forks on the 3d day of July.</p>

<p>The expedition had now completely encircled the
region of the Upper Yellowstone. At one point Captain
Raynolds had stood where his eye could range
over all that country which has since become so
famous; but this was the limit of his endeavor. The
Yellowstone wonderland was spared the misfortune of
being discovered at so early a day&mdash;a fact quite as
fortunate as any in its history.</p>

<p>It will be interesting now to survey this region as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
known at the time of the Raynolds Expedition.
Nothing of importance occurred to increase public
knowledge of it until 1870, and Captain
Raynolds'<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a>
Report is therefore the latest authentic utterance concerning
it prior to the date of actual discovery. In
this report Captain Raynolds says:</p>

<p>"Beyond these [the mountains south-east of the
Park], is the valley of the Upper Yellowstone, which
is as yet a <i>terra incognita</i>. My expedition passed entirely
around, but could not penetrate it&#8230;.
Although it was June, the immense body of snow
baffled all our exertions, and we were compelled to
content ourselves with listening to marvelous tales of
burning plains, immense lakes, and boiling springs,
without being able to verify these wonders. I know
of but two men who claim to have ever visited this
part of the Yellowstone Valley&mdash;James Bridger and
Robert Meldrum. The narratives of both these men
are very remarkable, and Bridger, in one of his recitals,
described an immense boiling spring, that is a
perfect counterpart of the geysers of Iceland. As he
is uneducated, and had probably never heard of the
existence of such natural wonders elsewhere, I have
little doubt that he spoke of that which he had actually
seen&#8230;. Bridger also insisted that immediately
west<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> of
the point at which we made our final
effort to penetrate this singular valley, there is a
stream of considerable size, which divides and flows
down either side of the water-shed, thus discharging
its waters into both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The Captain concludes this particular part of his
report as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not doubt, therefore, that at no very distant
day, the mysteries of this region will be fully revealed;
and, although small in extent, I regard the
valley of the Upper Yellowstone as the most interesting
unexplored district in our widely expanded
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maynadier also contributes a few interesting
observations upon this region. The vast importance
of that extensive mass of mountains, as a
reservoir of waters for the country round about, impressed
him deeply. He says, somewhat ostentatiously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my fancy warmed with the wealth of desolation
before me, I found something to admire in the
calm self-denial with which this region, content with
barren magnificence, gives up its water and soil to
more favored countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the Yellowstone River, he was told that it had
its source &ldquo;in a lake in the impenetrable fastnesses of
the Rocky Mountains;&rdquo; and that for some distance
below the lake it flowed through a narrow gorge, up
which &ldquo;no one has ever been able to travel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it is the map prepared by Captain Raynolds
that tells a more interesting story even than his written
report. It reveals at once to the eye what was
known as well as what was unknown of the Upper
Yellowstone. Extending in a south-easterly and
north-westerly direction, is a large elliptical space,
within which geographical features are represented
by dotted lines, indicating that they are put in by
hearsay only. In the midst of a surrounding country,
which is already mapped with great accuracy,
there is a region wholly unknown to the geographer.
A cordon of mountains encircles it, and shows the
limit of official effort to gain a correct knowledge of
it. Within this enchanted inclosure lies the region
approximately defined by the 44th and 45th parallels
of latitude and the 110th and 111th meridians of
longitude, which now constitutes the Yellowstone
National Park. There one may catch glimpses,
through the uncertain haze of tradition, of the geysers,
hot springs, Lake, Falls, Grand Cañon, Mammoth
Hot Springs, and Two-Ocean Pass. This was
the net result of fifty years' desultory wandering in
and about and over this &ldquo;mystic&rdquo; region.</p>

<p>Raynolds' report, it must be remembered, was the
first official recognition in any form of the probable
existence of extensive volcanic phenomena in the region
of the Upper Yellowstone. Had it been published
immediately after the expedition, and had not
public attention been totally engrossed with other
matters of overshadowing importance, this region must
have become fully known in the early Sixties. But
within a month after the return of Captain Raynolds
to civilization there had taken place the national
election which was the signal for attempted armed
disruption of the Union. A year later found every
officer of the Army called to new fields of duty.
Western exploration entirely ceased until 1865, and
was not vigorously resumed for some years thereafter.
Captain Raynolds' report did not appear until 1868,
although his map was published several years earlier
in order to meet a demand for it by the new settlers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in western Montana, Nothing transpired in the
meantime to make the general public familiar with
this region, and the picture here given is therefore
substantially correct down to the date of the celebrated
Washburn expedition.</p>

<p class="caption2">GOLD IN MONTANA.</p>


<p>Perhaps the most fascinating pages of American
history are those which recount the annals of the discoveries
of gold and silver. No one can appreciate
the magnitude of those various movements by a
simple perusal of statistics of the mineral wealth
which they disclosed. He must pass through the
mining belts and note how almost every rod of
ground, over vast tracts of country, is filled with prospect
holes that attest the miner&rsquo;s former presence. If
the trapper carried the tools of his trade to haunts
remote and inaccessible, the miner, with his pick and
shovel, certainly outdid him. One can readily understand
that, as soon as such a movement should be
directed toward the region of the Upper Yellowstone,
the wonders of that region would speedily be
revealed.</p>

<p>The presence of gold in the mountains of Montana
was first noticed as far back as 1852. Later, in 1858,
the Stuart brothers, James and Granville, founders of
Montana, discovered gold in the Deer Lodge Valley;
but they were destitute of equipments, and so constantly
exposed to the hostility of the Blackfeet, that
they went to Fort Bridger in the south-west corner of
Wyoming, and did not return until late in 1860.</p>

<p>It was in 1860 and 1861 that the rich mines
on the Salmon and Boisé rivers were discovered.
In 1862 the tide of discovery swept across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
mountains into Montana. The rich mines on Pioneer
Creek, the Big Prickly Pear, the Big Hole River,
North Boulder Creek, and at Bannock and other
points, became known. Although there were scarcely
a thousand people in Montana in the winter of
1862-3, the news of the great discoveries marshaled
a host of immigrants ready to enter the territory
in the following spring. These were largely
re-enforced by adventurers from both the northern
and southern states, who, with little credit to their
courage or patriotism, sought in these remote regions
exemption from the tributes and levies of war. The
immigrants were welcomed in the spring of 1863 by
the news of the discovery of Alder Gulch, the richest
of all gold placers. The work of prospecting, already
being pushed with vigor, was stimulated to an extraordinary
degree by this magnificent discovery. Prospecting
parties scoured the country in all directions,
often with loss of life through the Indians, but rarely,
after the first two or three years, with any substantial
success. Some of these expeditions have a particular
connection with our narrative because they
passed across portions of what is now the Yellowstone
Park.</p>

<p>The most important of them occurred in August and
September, 1863. It was led by Walter W. DeLacy,
an engineer and surveyor of some distinction in the
early history of Montana. The party at one time
numbered forty-two men, although this number did
not continue constant throughout the expedition. Its
sole object was to &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; the country. Evidently
nothing in the line of topographical reconnaissance
was thought of, for Captain DeLacy says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
&ldquo;there was not a telescope, and hardly a watch, in
the whole party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expedition left Virginia City, August 3d;
passed south into Idaho until it struck the Snake
River, and then ascended that stream to the region
about Jackson Lake. Near the mouth of Buffalo
Fork a halt was made, a corral was built to hold the
stock, and a miners' meeting held at which rules were
adopted to govern the miners in the contemplated
examination of the country. The party then broke
up into small groups and set out in different directions
so as to cover as much ground as possible. The
last four days of August were spent in this search,
but with failure in every direction. This discouragement
led to the abandonment of the expedition.
Fifteen men set out for home by the way they had
come, while DeLacy and twenty-seven men resolved
to reach the Madison River and the settlements by
going north. A day later this party entered the territory
which is now the Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>The route lay up the Snake River to its junction
with Lewis River where the hot springs of that locality
were discovered. Here another separation occurred.
About half the party went back down the
river to re-examine a locality where they thought
they had found some fair prospects. They soon returned,
however, unsuccessful. The main party under
DeLacy ascended the hills to the west of the
river to seek a more practicable route. They soon
reached the summit of the plateau where they discovered
what are now Hering and Beula lakes, and
noted their divergent drainage. Thence they passed
north over Pitchstone Plateau until they struck the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
valley of Moose Creek. They descended this stream
for a few miles and came to a large lake, which they
supposed to be tributary to either the Madison or the
Yellowstone Rivers. To their great surprise they
found, upon rounding its southern point, that it
drained <i>south</i> into the Snake. This is what is now
called Shoshone Lake.</p>

<p>From the outlet of the lake, DeLacy sent a man
down stream to examine the river. This reconnaissance
resulted in the discovery of Lewis Lake and the
hot springs basin there. When DeLacy resumed his
route, he followed along the east shore of the lake
to its northern extremity, and then ascended the
beautiful open valley of DeLacy Creek. He crossed
the Continental Divide at the head of the valley, and
camped on the evening of September 8th some miles
beyond the Divide toward the Firehole River. The
next morning, September 9, 1863, he came upon the considerable
stream of hot water which flows down a mountain
ravine into the Lower Geyser Basin close by the
Great Fountain Geyser. The reader will learn with
some amazement that our party thought little enough
of this wonderful locality to pass directly through it
without halt or perceptible delay. Before the camping
hour of the afternoon had arrived, they were
many miles away at the junction of the Gibbon and
Firehole rivers.</p>

<p>The other section of the party, which had gone down
the Snake from its junction with Lewis River, soon returned,
followed up the river to Lewis and Shoshone
lakes, passed around the western end of the latter
lake discovering its extensive geyser basin, and thence
crossed over to the Madison. This stream they descended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
through the geyser basins, and followed the
main party to the settlements.</p>

<p>DeLacy might have passed into history as the real
discoverer of the Yellowstone wonderland, but for the
fact that he failed to appreciate the true importance
of what he saw. In that, however, he was no exception
to the general rule of immigrants. The search for gold
with them so far overshadowed all other matters, that
it would have required something more than geysers to
divert them, even momentarily, from its prosecution.
Although DeLacy kept a daily journal of his expedition,
and noted therein the various items of interest
along his route, he did not publish it until 1876, long
after public interest had been strongly attracted to
the geyser regions. He did, however, publish a map
of the country through which he passed, and on this
map he correctly noted the drainage of Shoshone Lake&mdash;something
which the Folsom, Washburn, and Hayden
(1871), expeditions all failed to do. He also noted the
various hot springs localities through which the party
passed. In a letter published in Raymond&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mineral
Resources of the States and Territories West of the
Rocky Mountains,&rdquo; in 1869, before the date of the
Washburn Expedition, he called attention to the existence
of geysers at the head of Shoshone Lake and
on the Madison River.</p>

<p>DeLacy&rsquo;s account, as finally published, is an interesting
early view of this region, and is remarkable for
its general correctness. That he failed to publish his
discoveries must be regarded as fortunate so far as the
Park is concerned, for the time had not yet come
when it was desirable that the real character of this
country should be made known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1863 to 1869 there were many other prospecting
parties in the region of the Upper Yellowstone. In
1863 one of these parties, numbering thirty or forty men,
ascended the Yellowstone and the East Fork to the
mouth of Soda Butte Creek, and thence crossed an intervening
ridge to the next northern tributary of the
East Fork. Here all their horses were stolen by Indians.
There were left only one or two mules on which
was packed all the baggage they could carry, the rest
being concealed in a cache. The party then separated
into two portions and prospected the country for several
days in the vicinity of Clark&rsquo;s Fork. They finally
returned, emptied the cache, and descended to the Yellowstone
where they found fair prospects near the present
north boundary of the Park. The expedition has
no permanent interest for this narrative except that it
left the two geographical names, &ldquo;Cache Creek&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bear Gulch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1864, a party of seventy-three men under James
Stuart passed from Deer Lodge, Montana, to the Yellowstone
Valley, and thence around the east base of
the Absaroka Range into the valley of the Stinkingwater.
The object of this expedition was to punish
the Indians for outrages of the previous year, and also
to prospect the country for gold. At the Stinkingwater,
Stuart was compelled to return home. The
party then separated into groups that gradually
worked their way back to the Montana settlements.
One of these small parties went as far south as the
Sweetwater River, then crossed to the Green and Snake
Rivers, and re-crossed the Continental Divide at Two-Ocean
Pass. They descended the Yellowstone, past
the Lake and Grand Cañon, and beyond the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
limits of the Park. Norris found remnants of their
camp debris seventeen years afterward.</p>

<p>In 1866, a party under one George Huston left Virginia
City, Montana, and ascended the Madison River
to the geyser basins. Thence they crossed to the
Yellowstone at Mud Geyser, ascended the river to the
lake, passed completely around the latter, discovering
Hart Lake on their way, and then descended the Yellowstone
by the Falls and Cañon, to Emigrant Gulch.
Here they were interviewed by a newspaper reporter,
and an account of their travels was published in the
<i>Omaha Herald</i>. They had seen about all there was
to be seen in the whole region.</p>

<p>At least two parties traversed the Park country in
1867. One of these gave names to Crevice, Hell-roaring
and Slough Creeks. An account of the wanderings
of the other party appeared in the <i>Montana
Post</i> of that year.</p>

<p>Many other parties and individuals passed through
this region during the Montana mining craze. Their
accounts appeared now and then in the local papers,
and were reprinted throughout the country. By 1869,
probably very few of the reading public had not heard
rumors of a strange volcanic region in the Far West.
In Montana, particularly, repeated confirmation of the
old trappers' tales was gradually arousing a deep interest,
and the time was fast approaching when explorations
for the specific purpose of verifying these
rumors were to begin.</p>

<p class="caption3">DISCOVERY.</p>


<p>The discovery of the Yellowstone Wonderland&mdash;by
which is here meant its full and final disclosure to the
world&mdash;was the work of three parties who visited and
explored it in the years 1869, 1870, and 1871, respectively.
The first of these expeditions was purely a
private enterprise. It consisted of three men, and
was the first party to enter this country with the express
purpose of verifying or refuting the floating
rumors concerning it. The second expedition was
of a mixed character, having semi-official sanction,
but being organized and recruited by private individuals.
This was the famous &ldquo;Yellowstone Expedition
of 1870&rdquo;&mdash;the great starting point in the post-traditional
history of the Park. The third expedition was
strictly official, under the military and scientific departments
of the government. It was a direct result
of the explorations of 1870, and was intended to satisfy
the public demand for accurate and official information
concerning this new region of wonders. It was
the final and necessary step in order that the government
might act intelligently and promptly for the
preservation of what was believed to be the most interesting
collection of wonders to be found in the
world.<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a>

<p class="caption3">THE EXPEDITION OF 1869.</p>

<p>The question of setting definitely at rest the constantly
multiplying rumors of wonderful volcanic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
phenomena around the sources of the Yellowstone,
began to be seriously agitated among the people of
Montana as early as 1867. An expedition was planned
for that year but came to nothing. A like result attended
a similar effort the following year. In 1869,
the proposition came near materializing, but fell
through at the last moment owing to the failure to
obtain a military escort. There were three members
of this proposed expedition, however, who refused to
be frightened off by any dangers which the situation
at that time promised. They had already provided
themselves with an elaborate equipment, and were determined,
with escort or without it, to undertake the
trip. The names of these men were David E. Folsom,
C. W. Cook, and William Peterson, the last
named being a native of Denmark. Armed with &ldquo;repeating
rifles, Colt&rsquo;s six-shooters, and sheath-knives,&rdquo;
with a &ldquo;double-barreled shot gun for small game;&rdquo;
and equipped with a &ldquo;good field-glass, pocket compass
and thermometer,&rdquo; and utensils and provisions
&ldquo;for a six weeks' trip,&rdquo; they set out from Diamond
City on the Missouri River, forty miles from Helena,
September 6, 1869.</p>

<p>The route lay up the Missouri to the Three Forks;
thence <i>via</i> Bozeman and Fort Ellis to the Yellowstone
River; and thence up the Yellowstone to its junction
with the East Fork inside the present limits of the
Park. From this point they crossed to the east bank
and followed up the river, passing through the many
groups of hot springs to be found east of the Grand
Cañon. On September 21st, they arrived at the Falls of
the Yellowstone, where they remained an entire day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Some distance above the rapids they re-crossed to the
west shore and then ascended the river past Sulphur
Mountain and Mud Volcano to Yellowstone
Lake. They then went to the extreme west shore
of the lake and spent some time examining the
surpassingly beautiful springs at that point. Thence
they crossed the mountains to Shoshone Lake, which
they took to be the head of the Madison, and from
that point struck out to the north-west over a toilsome
country until they reached the Lower Geyser
Basin near Nez Percé Creek. Here they saw the Fountain
Geyser in action and the many other phenomena
in that locality. They ascended the Firehole River to
Excelsior Geyser and Prismatic Lake, and then turned
down the river on their way home. They were absent
on the expedition thirty-six days.</p>

<p>It is said that these explorers were so astonished at
the marvels they had seen that &ldquo;they were, on their return,
unwilling to risk their reputations for veracity by
a full recital of them to a small company whom their
friends had assembled to hear the account of their explorations.&rdquo;
But Mr. Folsom later prepared a most
entertaining narrative of his journey which was published
in the <i>Western Monthly</i>, of Chicago, in July,
1871.<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> This
article deserves a high rank in the literature
of the Park. It is free from exaggeration and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
contains some descriptions unsurpassed by any subsequent
writer. The article, and personal interviews
with the author and his companions, had a strong influence
in leading to the important expedition next
to be described.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Z_26" id="Footnote_Z_26"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_Z_26"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> It
is only through the undiminished loyalty of Mr. N. P.
Langford to every thing pertaining to the welfare of the Yellowstone
National Park that this article has been saved from oblivion.
The office of the <i>Western Monthly</i> was destroyed by the great Chicago
fire of 1871, and all the files of the magazine were lost. Mr.
Folsom had lost or given away all copies in his possession. So
far as is known there is but one remaining copy of this issue and
that is owned by Mr. Langford. In 1894, Mr. Langford caused the
article to be reprinted in handsome pamphlet form, with an interesting
preface by himself, and it will now receive the recognition
which it justly deserves.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">THE EXPEDITION OF 1870.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone Expedition of 1870, more commonly
known as the Washburn-Doane Expedition, was the
culmination of the project of discovery to which frequent
reference has already been made. At this time
the subject was exciting a profound interest throughout
Montana, and the leading citizens of the territory
were active in organizing a grand expedition. General
Sheridan, who passed through Helena just prior
to his departure for the scene of the Franco-German
War, spent some time in arranging for a military escort
to accompany the party. The project did not assume
definite shape until about the middle of August,
and when the time for departure arrived, Indian
alarms caused a majority of the party to repent their
decision to join it. Finally, their were only nine persons
who were willing to brave all dangers for the
success of the undertaking. These nine were:</p>

<p>General Henry D. Washburn, Surveyor-General of
Montana, chief of the expedition, and author of a
series of valuable &ldquo;notes&rdquo; describing it.<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a>

<p>Hon. Nathaniel P. Langford, who published a series
of articles in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> which gave general
publicity to the news of discovery. He became first
Superintendent of the Park.</p>

<p>Hon. Cornelius Hedges, who first proposed setting

<p>Hon. Truman C. Everts, ex-U. S. Assessor for Montana,
whose experience upon the expedition forms the
most painful and thrilling chapter in the annals of the
Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Hon. Samuel T. Hauser, President of the First National
Bank of Helena, and later Governor of Montana.</p>

<p>Walter Trumbull, son of the late Senator Trumbull.
He published an account of the expedition in the

<p>Other civilian members of the expedition were
Benjamin Stickney, Jr., Warren C. Gillette, and Jacob
Smith.</p>

<p>The personnel of this party is sufficient evidence of
the wide-spread interest which was being taken at the
time in the region of the Upper Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The party proceeded from Helena to Fort Ellis, one
hundred and twenty-five miles, where they were to
receive a military escort promised by General Hancock,
at that time commanding the department in
which Fort Ellis was located. The post order detailing
this escort is dated August 21, 1870, and directs
Lieutenant Gustavus C. Doane, Second Cavalry, with
one sergeant and four privates, &ldquo;to escort the Surveyor-General
of Montana to the falls and lakes of the
Yellowstone and return.&rdquo; There is a significant absence
in this order of any reference to geysers or hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
springs; and the discreet post commander evidently
did not intend to commit himself to a recognition of
their existence on the strength of such knowledge as
was then available. His incredulity was indeed largely
shared by the members of the party themselves. Mr.
Hedges subsequently said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a more confirmed set of sceptics never
went out into the wilderness than those who composed
our party, and never was a party more completely
surprised and captivated with the wonders of nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Doane, than whom no member of the
expedition holds a more honorable place in its history,
has left on record a similar confession.</p>

<p>The party as finally organized, including two packers
and two colored cooks, numbered nineteen individuals.
Thirty-five horses and mules, thoroughly
equipped for a month&rsquo;s absence, completed the &ldquo;outfit,&rdquo;
and made altogether quite an imposing cavalcade.</p>

<p>August 22, 1870, the expedition left Fort Ellis,
crossed to the Yellowstone, and ascended that stream
through the First and Second Cañons, past the
&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Slide&rdquo; and Cinnabar Mountain, to the present
north boundary line of the Park at the mouth of
the Gardiner River. At this point they were within
five miles of the celebrated Mammoth Hot Springs
which are now the first attraction to meet the tourist&rsquo;s
eye on entering the Park. But the party kept close
to the Yellowstone, instead of taking the modern
route up the Gardiner, and missed this wonder altogether.</p>

<p>It was August 26th when the expedition entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the present territory of the Park. Lieutenant Doane
and Mr. Everts, with one soldier and two hunters
picked up on the way, rode in advance along the brink
of the Third Cañon and across the high plateau between
the Gardiner and Tower Creek, camping at
nightfall upon the latter stream. In the broad open
valley near the junction of the Yellowstone and East
Fork, a small tepid sulphur spring gave them the first
evidence of their approach to the regions of volcanic
activity.</p>

<p>Next day, the remainder of the party arrived. Two
days were spent in examining the beautiful Tower
Falls, and&mdash;to our tyros in geyser exploration&mdash;the
wonderful hot spring formations to be seen at that
point. Here they also had for the first time glimpses
of the Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The party left Tower Creek on the 29th of August,
and followed up the river over the east flank of Mount
Washburn. As their progress lifted them rapidly
above the surrounding country, a marvelously beautiful
landscape unfolded itself to their view. Presently
an interesting incident occurred, which shall stand
here in Lieutenant Doane&rsquo;s own language:</p>

<p>"Through the mountain gap formed by the cañon,
and on the interior slopes some twenty [evidently a
misprint] miles distant, an object now appeared which
drew a simultaneous expression of wonder from every
one of the party. A column of steam, rising from
the dense woods to the height of several hundred
feet, became distinctly visible. We had all heard
fabulous stories of this region, and were somewhat
skeptical of appearances. At first it was pronounced
a fire in the woods, but presently some one noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that the vapor rose in regular puffs, as if expelled
with great force. Then conviction was forced upon
us. It was indeed a great column of steam, puffing
away on the lofty mountain side, escaping with a
roaring sound audible at a long distance, even through
the heavy forest. A hearty cheer rang out at this
discovery, and we pressed onward with renewed enthusiasm."</p>

<p>The party then ascended the lofty mountain to their
right, now known as Mt. Washburn, and from its
summit looked around upon the vast panorama which
is now included in the Yellowstone National Park.
Had old James Bridger been present at that moment,
he would have received ample vindication for long-standing
injustice at the hands of his incredulous
countrymen. <i>There</i> were the Cañon and Falls and
Lake of the Yellowstone, with evidence enough of
boiling springs and geysers! The enthusiasm of the
party was unbounded, and Lieutenant Doane exultingly
declares that they were &ldquo;more than satisfied
with the opening up of the campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pack-train continued its course along the side
of the mountain, and went into camp after a march
of only twelve miles. That evening, Messrs. Washburn,
Doane, and Hedges went on ahead of the main
party, discovering the extensive mud springs at the
southern base of the mountain, and finally reached
the verge of a cliff beyond which yawned the stupendous
cañon of the Yellowstone. It was the first
real view from near by, but darkness prevented further
examination.</p>

<p>The next day saw the arrival of the party at the
Falls of the Yellowstone, close by the mouth of Cascade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Creek, which, with its Crystal Falls, received
that day their present names. The remainder of this
day, August 30th, and the next, were spent in exploring
the cañon and measuring the heights of the falls.
Messrs. Hauser and Stickney descended the sides of the
cañon to the brink of the river about two miles below the
falls; and Lieutenant Doane and Private McConnell
accomplished the same difficult feat further down. It
needs not to be said that the members of the party
were profoundly impressed with the incomparable
scenery of the Grand Cañon, although their descriptions
of it are, perhaps, least satisfactory of any they
have left us.</p>

<p>From the Cañon the party ascended the now placid
river amid ever-changing wonders. They passed Sulphur
Mountain and the uncanny region around the
Mud Volcano and Mud Geyser, then crossed to the
east shore of the river, and finally went into camp,
September 3d, on the shore of the Yellowstone Lake.
Here our explorers were again in ecstacies, and not
without cause; for, seen under favoring conditions,
this &ldquo;watery solitude&rdquo; is one of the most beautiful
objects in nature.</p>

<p>After a day spent in this camp, the expedition continued
by slow stages up the east shore of the lake.
Messrs. Doane and Langford scaled the lofty Absaroka
Range just east of the lake, being the first
white men known to have accomplished this feat, and
their names now designate two of its noblest summits.</p>

<p>September 7th, the party forded the Upper Yellowstone
and traversed the almost impassable labyrinths
of fallen timber between the several projecting arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
on the south of the lake. It was on this portion of
the route, September 9th, that Mr. Everts became
separated from his party, lost his horse with all his
accoutrements, and commenced those &ldquo;thirty-seven
days of peril,&rdquo; which so nearly cost him his life. This
unfortunate affair cast a deep gloom over the little
party and seriously interfered with the progress of the
expedition. A week was spent in searching for the
lost companion, without other result than the discovery
of the hot springs basins at Hart Lake and on the
west shore of the Yellowstone Lake.</p>

<p>At length it was concluded that Mr. Everts had
either been killed or had wandered back home; and
it was resolved to wait no longer. The party were
surfeited with sight-seeing, and believed that they had
now covered the whole ground. They therefore determined
to strike across the mountains to the Madison
and follow that stream to the settlements. They set
out on the morning of September 17th, over rugged
hills and through fallen timber, crossing the Continental
Divide twice, and camping that night in an
open glade on a small branch of the Firehole. While
passing the second time over the Divide, they caught
a glimpse of Shoshone Lake and erroneously thought
it to be the head of the Firehole River.</p>

<p>At 9 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, September 18th, the march was resumed.
The party soon reached the Firehole just above Kepler
Cascade and thence followed down the course of the
stream. Tourists who have visited the Park since
1891, when the new road from the Upper Basin to
the Lake was opened, will remember that immediately
after leaving &ldquo;Old Faithful&rdquo; they plunge into an unbroken
pine forest and see no other evidences of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
geyser action until they reach the Lake. The situation
of our homeward-bound explorers can thus be
easily understood. They were traveling toward the
geysers. The dense forest concealed every thing beyond
the radius of a few hundred feet. In unsuspecting
mood, bent only on getting home to tell their
wonderful story, and perhaps to find their missing
companion, they moved down the river, crossing it
considerably below the site of the present bridge
above the Upper Basin, and suddenly emerged from
the timber into an open treeless valley. It was
nearly noon of a clear, cool September day. Directly
in front of them, scarcely two hundred yards away,
a vertical column of water and steam was shooting
upward a hundred and fifty feet into the air. The
bright sunlight turned the clear water into a mass of
glittering crystals, and a gentle breeze wafted the
vast white curtain of steam far to the right across the
valley. Thus it was that &ldquo;Old Faithful,&rdquo; as if forewarned
of the approach of her distinguished visitors,
gave them her most graceful salutation; and thus she
bowed out the era of tradition and fable, and ushered
the civilized world into the untrodden empire
of the Fire King. Little wonder that our astonished
explorers &ldquo;spurred their jaded horses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gathered
around the wonderful phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party spent only the remainder of the day and
the following morning in the Upper Basin; but in
that time saw seven of the principal geysers in action,
and gave them their present names.<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> They then
passed down the river through the Middle and Lower
Basins, but stopped to examine only such curiosities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
as were close by the river. Their rations were nearly
gone, their lost companion was not found, and the desire
to tell what they had already seen was greater
than the desire to see more. They therefore made
haste for home, and on the evening of September 19th
encamped where the Firehole and Gibbon Rivers
unite to form the Madison. From this point the
party journeyed steadily homeward, conversing on
the expedition of the past month, and planning
how their great discovery might best be brought to
the attention of the world.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AD_30" id="Footnote_AD_30"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AD_30"><span class="label">[AD]</span></a> See
list of geysers, <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.</p></div>

<p>The news of this expedition created intense and
wide-spread interest throughout the country. Messrs.
Washburn, Hedges, Trumbull, and others, prepared
numerous descriptive articles for the local Montana
papers, many of them among the best that have ever
been written upon the Park, and these were reproduced
in every important paper in the land. The
<i>Helena Herald</i>, of October 27, 1870, only a month
after the return of the party, refers to the extraordinary
interest aroused by these articles, so unlike
the sixty years' indifference which had marked the
history of this region.</p>

<p>These preliminary and hasty reports were followed
by more studied efforts. Lieutenant Doane&rsquo;s masterly
report was completed December 15, 1870. Besides its
intrinsic merit, it has the distinction of being the first
official report upon the Upper Yellowstone country.
It passed through the customary military channels
and was finally sent to Congress, February 24, 1871.
Prof. S. F. Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution, also
presented the information gathered by Lieutenant
Doane to the Philosophical Society of Washington
during the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Messrs. Langford and Trumbull prepared entertaining
magazine articles, which, however, could not be
gotten to press until the following May and June.
But Mr. Langford in the meantime did effective work
from the lecture stand. In Helena, Minneapolis,
New York and Washington, he told the story of what
he had seen. In Washington, the Hon. James G.
Blaine, Speaker of the House, presided at the lecture,
and in the audience was Dr. F. V. Hayden, who was
destined to play a prominent part in the history of
the Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>From whatever point of view considered, this expedition
is one of the most remarkable in our annals.
From Helena to the farthest point reached by the
party, the route passed over was nearly three hundred
miles long. The region of the Upper Yellowstone is
perhaps the most difficult of access in the entire
country. Even to-day, it is an almost certain place in
which to get lost, if one is not thoroughly familiar
with wilderness travel and happens to stray away
from the beaten path. In 1870, moreover, the danger
from hostile Indians was a constant and formidable
menace, and the party was more than once reminded
of it during the progress of the expedition. But in
spite of all these difficulties, the success of the enterprise
was so complete, its incidents were so full of romance,
and its results were so far-reaching and important,
that it well deserves the wide attention it has
received.</p>


<p>THE JOINT GOVERNMENT EXPEDITION OF 1871.</p>

<p>The direct result of the expedition of 1870 was to
cause the U. S. Geological Survey to change its programme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for the season of 1871, so as to give attention
to the new wonderland; and also to cause the military
authorities to send a well-appointed engineer party to
the same locality. These two expeditions, one under
Dr. Hayden and the other under Captains Barlow and
Heap, of the Engineer Corps of the Army, moved for
the most part together, camping near each other, and
accompanied by the same military escort. Particular
attention will here be given only to such features of
these expeditions as pertain to new discoveries.</p>

<p>At the very outset of their journey, they branched
off from the Washburn route at the mouth of the
Gardiner River, and by ascending this stream, discovered
the wonderful formations now known as the
Mammoth Hot Springs. From this point, the parties
traveled eastward to Tower Creek; thence over Mt.
Washburn, and past the Cañon and Falls, to Sulphur
Mountain, Mud Geyser, and the Lake; thence by a
new route across the mountains to the Lower Geyser
Basin; thence to the Upper Basin; thence east, across
the mountains again, past Shoshone Lake to Yellowstone
Lake; thence around the head of this body of
water to its outlet; thence across the country, by separate
routes, to the mouth of Soda Butte Creek; and
thence down the East Fork to Baronett&rsquo;s Bridge
(which had been built only a few months before), and
out of the Park by way of Mammoth Hot Springs.</p>

<p>The original work done by these parties, besides
the discovery of the springs on the Gardiner, was the
opening of a route between the Yellowstone River
and the Lower Geyser Basin; the exploration of the
Lower Basin; the mapping of the shore line of Yellowstone
Lake, by Dr. Hayden; the mapping of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
head waters of the Snake River, by Captain Barlow;
and some hasty explorations in the valley of the East
Fork of the Yellowstone, now called Lamar River.</p>

<p>The chief value of these explorations, however, was
not in the line of original discovery, but in the large
collection of accurate data concerning the entire region.
The photographs were of immense value. Description
might exaggerate, but the camera told the
truth; and in this case the truth was more remarkable
than exaggeration. Unfortunately for Captain Barlow&rsquo;s
collection, the great Chicago fire almost entirely
destroyed it. The same cause delayed the appearance
of his report until six weeks after the Park Bill was
passed. An interesting and complete summary, however,
appeared as a supplement in the <i>Chicago Journal</i>
for January 13, 1872. The report and collection of
photographs and specimens by Dr. Hayden were
therefore the principal results of this season&rsquo;s work,
and they played a decisive part in the events of the
winter of 1871-2.</p>

<p>With the close of the expeditions of 1871, the discovery
of the Yellowstone wonderland was made
complete. It remained to see what Congress would
do with so unique and valuable a possession.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_I_CHAPTER_X" id="PT_I_CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="caption2">THE NATIONAL PARK IDEA&mdash;ITS ORIGIN AND REALIZATION.</p>


<p>The first steamboat to ascend the Missouri River as
far as to the mouth of the Yellowstone arrived at that
point on the 26th of June, 1832. By a happy coincidence
it bore the name <i>Yellowstone</i>. We are indebted
for the conception of the National Park idea to a
passenger upon this boat who was destined to become
one of the most interesting characters America has
produced. Every one bears in memory those pictures
of Indian life which thrilled their youthful imagination
with visions of camping-grounds, council fires,
exciting buffalo hunts, and the wild and picturesque
costumes of the red men. Very few, however,
realize how largely all that is best in these pictures
has flowed from a single source. The name of
George Catlin is by no means familiar except to the
specialist. His work reaches the public eye through
so many different channels, and so often without any
acknowledgment of its origin, that the origin itself
is very generally lost to view.</p>

<p>To no other individual does the Indian race owe so
much for the perpetuity in history and art of its life
and customs. From an early age he displayed an enthusiasm
for every thing pertaining to the aboriginal
races which can be adequately described only by the
word worship. He abandoned the profession for
which he had been educated, and enlisted his whole
energy in the service of brush and pencil, apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for the single purpose of indulging this passion of his
life. He once wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unaided and unadvised, I resolved to use my art
and so much of the labors of my future life as might
be required in rescuing from oblivion the looks and
customs of the vanishing races of native man in America,
to which I plainly saw they were hastening before
the approach and certain progress of
civilization.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AE_31" id="Footnote_AE_31"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AE_31"><span class="label">[AE]</span></a> Manners,
Customs, etc., of the North American Indians. See
<a href="#bibl_62">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>This high purpose Catlin followed throughout the
remainder of his life with unwavering fidelity. He
visited almost every Indian tribe in North America,
gathering sketches and making descriptive notes. He
also visited South America, and afterward spent many
years in Europe exhibiting his work. The result of
his labors was a gallery of more than six hundred
pictures, now happily forever safe under the protection
of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, wherein
he delineated the portraits of famous chiefs and the
scenes and customs of Indian life. This work he
supplemented with the scarcely less valuable work of
his pen, leaving behind him probably the best popular
description of the native races that has ever been
written. His work is a perennial fountain to which
students of Indian themes will ever resort. Valuable
as it was considered in his lifetime, each passing year
makes it more valuable still.</p>

<p>Catlin&rsquo;s enthusiasm for every thing pertaining to Indian
life, and the grief with which he beheld the certain
fading away of it all before the rapid progress of
civilization, suggested to him the idea which was to
find partial fulfillment at the time to which our narrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
has now been carried. In order to preserve, at least
on a small scale, the native fauna of America, and a
remnant of the Indian races, he proposed that the government
should set apart, in some suitable locality of
the West, a large tract of land, to be preserved forever
as a &ldquo;<i>Nation&rsquo;s Park</i>, containing man and beast,
in all the wildness and freshness of their nature&rsquo;s
beauty.&rdquo; With his natural enthusiasm and vigor, he
unfolded his idea, concluding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would ask no other monument to my memory,
nor any other enrollment of my name among the
famous dead, than the reputation of having been the
founder of such an institution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the report of the late Prof. Joseph Henry to the
Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for
1871, it is stated that Catlin made a proposition to
the government in 1832 &ldquo;to reserve the country
around these [the Yellowstone] geysers as a public
park.&rdquo; While it is more than probable, considering
the date, and the wide acquaintance of Mr. Catlin
with the traders and Indians of the West, that he had
heard of the geyser regions, still there is not sufficient
evidence attainable to justify our acceptance of the
above statement. But in every thing else except the
particular locality, and the plan of providing a reservation
for the Indians, Catlin&rsquo;s idea was the same as
that finally adopted by Congress.</p>

<p>Although the project of creating a vast National
Park in the West originated with George Catlin, it is
certain that Congress could never have been brought
to act favorably upon it, except under the influence
of some extraordinary motive. That motive was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
supplied when the innumerable unique and marvelous
wonders of the Yellowstone were made known.
Their preservation at once became a matter of high
public duty, which could be accomplished only by reserving
from settlement the region around them.</p>

<p>Since the Park was created and has to such a
marked degree received the approval of the people,
numerous claimants have arisen for the honor of having
first suggested the idea. In truth, no special
credit for originality should attach to the matter. It
was a natural, an unavoidable proposition. To those
who first saw these wonders, and were not so absorbed
with gold-seeking as to be incapable of appreciating
their importance, it was clear that, within a
few years, they must become objects of universal
interest. It was equally clear that the land around
them would soon be taken up by private parties, and
that the beautiful formations would be carried off for
mercenary purposes; in short, that the history of
Niagara and of the Yosemite would repeat itself in
the Yellowstone. To avoid such a calamity only one
course was open, and that was for the government to
retain control of the entire region. That the necessity
of such a course should have been set forth independently
by several different parties, as we find it to
have been, is therefore not in the least surprising.</p>

<p>But in as much as the development of the project
must have started from some one source, it is of interest
historically to determine what this source was.
We find it to have been the Washburn Expedition of
1870.<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> The
subject was discussed by the party at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
first camp after leaving the geyser regions near the
junction of the Firehole and Gibbon Rivers. The
date was September 19, 1870. The members of the
party were sitting around the camp-fire after supper,
conversing about what they had seen, and picturing
to themselves the important pleasure resort which so
wonderful a region must soon become. The natural
impulse to turn the fruits of discovery to the personal
profit of the discoverer made its appearance, and it
was suggested that it would be a &ldquo;profitable speculation&rdquo;
to take up land around the various objects of
interest. The conversation had not proceeded far on
these lines when one of the party, Cornelius Hedges,
interposed and said that private ownership of that
region, or any part of it, ought never to be countenanced;
but that it ought to be set apart by the government
and forever held to the unrestricted use of
the people. This higher view of the subject found
immediate acceptance with the other members of the
party. It was agreed that the project should be at
once set afoot and pushed vigorously to a finish.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AF_32" id="Footnote_AF_32"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AF_32"><span class="label">[AF]</span></a> Mr.
Folsom deserves mention in this connection. In the
manuscript of his article in the <i>Western Monthly</i> was a reference to
the Park idea; but the publishers cut out a large part of his paper,
giving only the descriptions of the natural wonders, and this
reference was cut out with the rest. Mr. Folsom also suggested
the idea to General Washburn, of which fact Mr. N. P. Langford
is still a living witness. From Mr. Folsom&rsquo;s suggestion, however,
as from Mr. Catlin&rsquo;s, no direct result can be traced.</p></div>

<p>As soon as the party reached Helena, a series of articles
appeared in the daily papers of that city describing
the late expedition, and in one of these, written
by Mr. Hedges and published in the <i>Helena Herald</i>
November 9, 1870, occurs what is believed to be the
first public reference to the Park project.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The next mention of the subject was in Mr. Langford&rsquo;s
lecture, delivered, as already related, in Washington,
January 19, 1871; in New York, January 21,
1871; and at a later date in Minneapolis. At each
of these places he closed his lecture with a reference
to the importance of setting apart this region as a
National Park. The <i>New York Tribune</i> of January
23, 1871, thus quotes Mr. Langford:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is probably the most remarkable region of
natural attractions in the world; and, while we already
have our Niagara and Yosemite, this new field
of wonders should be at once withdrawn from occupancy,
and set apart as a public National Park for
the enjoyment of the American people for all time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such is the origin of the idea which has found realization
in our present Yellowstone Park. The history
of the Act of Dedication, by which the Park was
created, may be briefly told. The general plan for a
vigorous prosecution of the project was arranged in
Helena, Montana, mainly by Nathaniel P. Langford,
Cornelius Hedges, and William H. Clagett, who had
just been elected delegate to Congress from Montana,
and who had already himself independently urged the
importance of converting this region into a public
park. Mr. Langford went to Washington when Congress
convened, and he and Mr. Clagett drew the
Park Bill, except as to description of boundaries, which
was furnished by Dr. Hayden. The bill was introduced
in the House by Mr. Clagett, December 18,
1871. Senator Pomeroy, of Kansas, had expressed a
desire to perform a like service in the Senate, and accordingly
Mr. Clagett, as soon as he had presented the
measure to the House, took a copy to the Senate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
chamber and gave it to Senator Pomeroy, who immediately
introduced it. In each House it was referred
to the Committee on Public Lands. In the Senate no
formal report was prepared. In the House the Hon.
Mark H. Dunnell, of Minnesota, chairman of the
sub-committee having the bill in charge, addressed a
letter under date of January 27, 1872, to the Secretary
of the Interior, asking his opinion upon the proposed
measure. The Secretary replied, under date of January
29th, fully indorsing the project, and submitting
a brief report by Dr. Hayden, which forcibly presented
all the main features of the case.</p>

<p>The bill, being thus before Congress, was put
through mainly by the efforts of three men, Dr. F. V.
Hayden, N. P. Langford, and Delegate William H.
Clagett. Dr. Hayden occupied a commanding position
in this work, as representative of the government
in the explorations of 1871. He was thoroughly familiar
with the subject, and was equipped with an
exhaustive collection of photographs and specimens
gathered the previous summer. These were placed
on exhibition, and were probably seen by all members
of Congress. They did a work which no other agency
could do, and doubtless convinced every one who saw
them that the region where such wonders existed
should be carefully preserved to the people forever.
Dr. Hayden gave to the cause the energy of a genuine
enthusiasm, and his work that winter will always hold
a prominent place in the history of the Park.</p>

<p>Mr. Langford, as already stated, had publicly advocated
the measure in the previous winter. He had
rendered service of the utmost importance, through
his publications in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i> in the preceding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
May and June. Four hundred copies of these magazines
were brought and placed upon the desks of members
of Congress on the days when the measure was
to be brought to vote. During the entire winter, Mr.
Langford devoted much of his time to the promotion
of this work.</p>

<p>The Hon. William H. Clagett, as delegate from the
Territory most directly interested in the passage of the
bill, took an active personal part in its advocacy from
beginning to end.</p>

<p>Through the efforts of these three gentlemen, and
others less conspicuously identified with the work,
this measure received perhaps the most thorough canvass
of any bill that has ever passed Congress. All
the members were personally visited and, with few
exceptions, won to the cause. The result was a practical
unanimity of opinion when the measure came to a
vote. This first took place in the Senate, the bill
being passed by that body January 30th. It was warmly
supported upon its passage by several members and opposed
by one, Senator Cole, of California; a fact the
more remarkable because that Senator had in his own
state&mdash;in the preemption by private parties of the
Yosemite wonderland&mdash;the most convincing example
possible of the wisdom of such a measure as that
proposed.</p>

<p>The Senate bill came up from the Speaker&rsquo;s table
in the House of Representatives, February 27th. Mr.
Dunnell stated that the Committee on Public Lands
had instructed him to ask the House to pass the Senate
bill. Hon. H. L. Dawes, of Massachusetts, warmly advocated
the measure, which was then passed by a decisive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
vote.<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> The
bill received the President&rsquo;s signature
March 1, 1872.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AG_33" id="Footnote_AG_33"></a>

yea and nay vote was taken in the Senate. The vote in
the House was&mdash;yeas, 115; nays, 65; not voting, 60.</p></div>

<p>This subject has been treated somewhat in detail because
there has long been a false impression among the
people as to who it was that first put forward this important
project. To no individual is the public more
indebted for the creation of the Park than to Dr. F. V.
Hayden, who was long prominently connected with the
geological surveys of the government. But he did not,
as is generally supposed, originate the idea. His
statement in his report for 1878, Vol. II, p. xvii,
that, &ldquo;so far as is now known, the idea of setting
apart a large tract about the sources of the Yellowstone
River, as a National Park, originated with the
writer,&rdquo; is entirely erroneous; and there is the less
excuse for the error in that Dr. Hayden had himself
heard the measure advocated by Mr. Langford in his
Washington lecture. In fact, he is known to have
said in later years, only a short time before his death,
while residing in Philadelphia, that when the project
was first talked of among the members of his party,
in the summer of 1871, he personally disapproved it
because he doubted the practicability of adequately
guarding so vast a region; but that, upon further reflection,
he became converted to the measure and was
thereafter its most ardent advocate.</p>

<p>But it is not so much actual facts, as what men believe
these facts to be, that controls human action;
and it is unquestionably true that the above quotation
correctly expresses the views of the great majority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of members of Congress when the Park measure was
before that body. It is not too much to say that Dr.
Hayden&rsquo;s influence, as the official representative of the
government, was a controlling factor in the passage
of that measure.</p>

<p>Perhaps no act of our national Congress has received
such general approbation at home or such profuse
commendation from foreigners as that creating
the Yellowstone National Park. The lapse of twenty
years has only served to confirm and extend its importance;
and to give additional force to the sentiment
so well expressed by the Earl of Dunraven
when he visited the Park in 1874:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All honor then to the United States for having bequeathed
as a free gift to man the beauties and curiosities
of &lsquo;Wonderland.&rsquo; It was an act worthy of a
great nation, and she will have her reward in the
praise of the present army of tourists, no less than in
the thanks of the generations of them yet to
come.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a>

<p>It was a notable act, not only on account of the
transcendent importance of the territory it was designed
to protect, but because it was a marked innovation
in the traditional policy of governments.
From time immemorial privileged classes have been
protected by law in the withdrawal, for their exclusive
enjoyment, of immense tracts for forests, parks and
game preserves. But never before was a region of
such vast extent as the Yellowstone Park set apart
for the use of all the people without distinction of
rank or wealth.</p>

<p>The example thus set by the United States has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
widely followed. We have now the Yosemite and
Sequoia National Parks, and numerous parks upon
the sites of great battle-fields. The State of New
York has a Niagara Park and contemplates setting
apart a portion of the Adirondack region. Minnesota
has the Itasca State Park, including the sources of
the Mississippi. Canada also has a public park at
Niagara, and a large reservation in the midst of the
finest scenery of the Rocky Mountains. New Zealand
has set a part for public use the region of her hot
springs and geysers. Finally the question is being
mooted of reserving a vast tract of Africa wherein
the large game of that continent may be kept from
annihilation.</p>

<p class="caption2">WHY SO LONG UNKNOWN?</p>


<p>There is no more singular fact connected with the
history of the Upper Yellowstone country than its
long immunity from the presence of white men.
From the date when Lewis and Clark first stood at
the Three Forks of the Missouri, less than one
hundred miles distant from this notable region, sixty-five
years elapsed before it was fully known. In the
meantime all the surrounding country had been
thoroughly explored. Cities, villages, farms and
highways had been established throughout the west.
A railroad had been built across the continent. But
around the head waters of the Yellowstone, the most
attractive region of all, it was still <i>terra incognita</i>.
A fact so remarkable requires adequate explanation.</p>

<p>The most difficult feature of the question is the
fact that no knowledge of this region appears ever to
have been derived from the Indians. Lewis and
Clark were told of the Great Falls of the Missouri,
and of other notable geographical features, long before
they saw them. But of the far more wonderful
falls of the Yellowstone, of the great lake in the
mountains, or of the marvelous volcanic phenomena
in the same neighborhood, they received no hint.
There is not a single instance on record, so far as we
can discover, except in the meager facts noted in an
earlier chapter, where rumors of this strange country
appear to have fallen from the lips of Indians. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
yet it was not a region unknown to them, for they
had certainly passed back and forth across it for a
long period in the past. Their deep silence concerning
it is therefore no less remarkable than mysterious.</p>

<p>But how was it that the long period of the fur trade
should have passed without disclosing this country?
To this question a more satisfactory answer may be
returned. The Upper Yellowstone country was indeed,
as we have seen, frequently visited in these early
years. But it was never favorite territory. Old trappers
say that, although it abounded in beaver, they
were not so plentiful as in lower altitudes, while on the
streams impregnated with mineral matter, the furs
were not so good. The seasons also were unpropitious.
The winter snows were so deep&mdash;they came so
early and remained so late&mdash;that little could be done
there except from the middle of June to the middle
of September. But furs taken during the summer
months are of inferior quality, and there was consequently
no inducement to trap. Moreover it was
generally at this time that the gatherings at posts and
rendezvous took place, and after these were over but
little time remained. Causes like these prevented extensive
operations in this region, and doubtless only a
comparatively small number of trappers ever saw it.</p>

<p>Then, the interest of the trader was against the dissemination
of any knowledge which might induce
immigration and hasten the certain ruin of his occupation.
The stress of competition also caused him to
remain silent concerning the places he had seen, lest
a rival should profit thereby. He took no pains to reveal
the country, and the trappers were too illiterate
to do so had they wished. With the one notable exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which has been mentioned in a previous chapter,
no important press notice of these regions appeared
during the entire sixty-five years.</p>

<p>The fur business itself quickly ran its course, and
with it disappeared all probability of an early discovery
of the geyser regions from this cause. The war with
Mexico followed, with the vast cession of territory
which it secured. Then came the highly important
discovery of gold in California. Already the Mormon
emigration had taken place. These great events completely
changed the character and purpose of western
exploration. The whole west was forgotten excepting
only California and the Salt Lake Valley, and the
routes leading to them. None of these led close to
the geyser regions. On the north were the British
fur trader&rsquo;s route, and the Missouri River route, both
of which led directly west to the Columbia. To the
south was the great thoroughfare along the Platte
River and though South Pass, leading to Utah, California
and Oregon. Still further south were the long
known routes near the border of Old Mexico. It was
hopelessly improbable that gold seekers bound to the
Pacific Coast along any of these routes would stray
into the mountain fastnesses about the sources of the
Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Finally the whole energy of the government in the
field of exploration was directed away from this region.
In the period from 1804-6, the date of Lewis
and Clark&rsquo;s expedition, to 1870, the date of the real
discovery of the Park, there were no fewer than one
hundred and ten explorations in the country west of
the Mississippi, nearly all of which had government
authority, and were conducted on a scientific basis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Of these, eighty-four were in the territory lately acquired
from Mexico, and mostly in the far south and
west. Nineteen were east of the Bighorn Mountains,
five north of the Yellowstone, and only two in the
region about the Upper Yellowstone. Of these two
expeditions one was that of Lewis and Clark, and was
in no wise intended to explore the Upper Yellowstone
further than might be necessary to find a good route
to the Pacific. This leaves but a single expedition of
the whole number, that of Captain Raynolds, which
was directed to this specific territory. How the purpose
of this expedition was defeated by the heavy
snow in the mountains and by the solar eclipse of
1860, has been elsewhere related.</p>

<p>And so it came about that it was the gold-seeker
who finally revealed the well-kept secret of the Yellowstone.
Itself destitute of mineral wealth, this region
could not escape the ubiquitous prospector. It
was not, indeed, by him that it was publicly proclaimed
to the world. He cared little for any country
that was destitute of &ldquo;color&rdquo; or &ldquo;pay.&rdquo; But the
hints he dropped put others on the track and opened
the door to real discovery.</p>

<p>This fact of long delay in the discovery of the Upper
Yellowstone is the most important in its history. Had
it been known at an earlier date, its fate would have
been deplorably different. The period of the fur
traders was too early for the interest of the people to
demand, or the power of the government to enforce,
its protection. If Captain Raynolds had discovered
it, all its most valuable tracts would have been preempted
long before the government would have been
able to give it attention. Fortunately, the discovery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was delayed until there was a considerable population
in the country near by, and the government was
prepared actively to consider the matter. Before
settlers could establish a permanent foothold, the
Park was created, and all the vexatious obstacles,
which might otherwise have defeated the project,
were avoided.</p>

<p class="caption2">LATER EXPLORATIONS.</p>


<p>As soon as the remarkable character of the country
about the sources of the Yellowstone became generally
known, there was a rush of explorers to its
borders. Every expedition that could possibly extend
the field of its labors in that direction did so,
and there was scarcely a summer during the next
twenty years that the Park was not the scene of some
official exploration or visit.</p>

<p>By far the most important of these were the various
expeditions under the United States Geological Survey.
Dr. Hayden was again in the country with two
parties in 1872, and very widely extended the range
of observations of the previous year. In 1878, survey
parties again entered the Park and resumed work
there on a much more minute and extensive scale.
The result of that year&rsquo;s explorations appeared in
1883 in the form of an elaborate report by Dr. Hayden
and his co-workers, which entered with much
detail into the more important subjects of scientific
interest. It was embellished with a great number of
engravings and colored plates, and with an exhaustive
series of topographical and geological maps. The
work was again taken up in 1883, and was continued
for several years. All questions of scientific importance
were investigated more thoroughly than ever
before, and many valuable official reports and monographs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
together with a superb map, have been the
result.</p>

<p>In 1872, General John Gibbon, U. S. A., with a
considerable party, made a tour of the Park, passing
by the usual route from Mammoth Hot Springs <i>via</i>
Mt. Washburn, the Grand Cañon, and the Lake, to
the Firehole Geyser Basins. On his way home he attempted
to ascend the north Fork of the Madison,
following an old trail; but he abandoned the attempt
after going a few miles. His name, which was given
to the river, has also attached to many other features
along that valley.</p>

<p>In 1873, Captain William A. Jones, of the Corps of
Engineers, passed through the Park as part of a more
extended reconnaissance. He was the first to carry a
party through the &ldquo;impassable barrier&rdquo; of the Absaroka
Range. Jones Creek, just east of the northern
portion of the Yellowstone Lake, shows where the
party entered the Park. From the Lake the expedition
passed down the east bank of the river to the
valley of Junction Butte; thence west to Mammoth
Hot Springs; thence back over the usual trail <i>via</i>
Tower Creek, Mt. Washburn, the Grand Cañon and
Mud Geyser, to the Lower Geyser Basin; thence <i>via</i>
the Upper Basin to the west shore of the Yellowstone
Lake; thence to the Upper Yellowstone River; thence
through Two-Ocean Pass and Two-Gwo-Tee Pass to
the valley of Wind River. The chief results of this
expedition, in the line of original discovery, were the
passage of the Absaroka Range, the verification of
the traditional &ldquo;Two-Ocean Water,&rdquo; between Atlantic
and Pacific Creeks, in Two-Ocean Pass, and the discovery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the extremely easy pass (Two-Gwo-Tee<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a>)
over the Continental Divide, between the Snake and
Wind Rivers. Prof. Theodore B. Comstock accompanied
the expedition as geologist. A valuable report
of the reconnaissance appeared in 1875.<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AI_35" id="Footnote_AI_35"></a>

<p>In 1875, Captain William Ludlow, of the Corps of
Engineers, made a reconnaissance from Carroll, Montana,
on the Missouri River, to the Yellowstone Park
and return. In the Park he followed the previously
traveled routes and developed little in the line of original
discovery. He succeeded, however, in obtaining
a very accurate measurement of the height of the
Yellowstone Falls, and his report<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> forms one of the
ablest brief descriptions of the Park extant. Among
his civil assistants was George Bird Grinnell, now
widely known as the editor of <i>Forest and Stream</i>,
and as one of the most steadfast and watchful
guardians the Park has ever had.</p>

<p>During the same season a distinguished party, consisting
of the Secretary of War, Gen. W. W. Belknap,
and several prominent officers and civilians, with Lieutenant
G. C. Doane, of National Park fame, as guide,
made a complete tour of the Park. An exceedingly
interesting narrative<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> of
the trip was written by Gen.
W. E. Strong, who was a member of the party.</p>

<p>In 1877, Gen. W. T. Sherman and staff made a tour
of the Park. His letters on the subject to the Secretary
of War, and the official report prepared by Gen.
O. M. Poe of his staff, form a valuable contribution to
the literature of the Park.<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p></div>

<p>In the same year Gen. O. O. Howard crossed the
reservation in pursuit of the Nez Percés Indians.</p>

<p>In 1880, the Hon. Carl Schurz, Secretary of the Interior,
accompanied by Gen. Crook with a large number
of officers and soldiers, and an immense pack
train, entered the Park from the valley of Henry Fork
and made an extended tour.</p>

<p>In 1881, Captain W. S. Stanton, of the Corps of Engineers,
made a reconnaissance through the Park, entering
by the way of Soda Butte Creek, and passing out by
the Madison Valley. The most important result of his
work in the Park was a more accurate table of distances
over some of the routes than had previously been in use.</p>

<p>In July and August of this year, the Hon. John
W. Hoyt, Governor of Wyoming, with a military escort
under command of Major Julius W. Mason, U. S.
A., made an extended reconnaissance to discover a practicable
wagon route to the Yellowstone Park from the
south-east. He entered the Park by way of the Upper
Yellowstone, passed through it by way of Yellowstone
and Shoshone Lakes, the Firehole Geyser Basins,
the Grand Cañon, the lower end of Yellowstone Lake,
and left it along the route by which Captain Jones
had entered in 1873.</p>

<p>In the years 1881 and 1882, General Sheridan, with
parties of considerable size, twice crossed the Park
and visited its most important points. His expeditions
were of great value to the Park from the forcible
warning which he gave to the public concerning
the demoralized condition of its civil administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The most elaborate expedition that ever passed
through this region took place in August,
1883.<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> It
included among its members the President of the
United States, the Secretary of War, the Lieutenant-General
of the Army, a United States Senator, and
several other distinguished officers and civilians. The
interesting part of the journey lay between Fort
Washakie, Wyo., and the Northern Pacific Railroad
at Cinnabar, Mont. The party traveled entirely on
horseback, accompanied by one of the most complete
pack trains ever organized in this or any other country,
and escorted by a full troop of cavalry. Couriers
were stationed every twenty miles with fresh relays,
and by this means communication was daily had with
the outside world. The whole distance traveled was
350 miles, through some of the wildest, most rugged,
and least settled portions of the west. No accident
or drawback occurred to mar the pleasure of the expedition.
The great pastime <i>en route</i> was trout fishing,
in which the President and Senator Vest were
acknowledged leaders. The phenomenal &ldquo;catches&rdquo;
of these distinguished sportsmen might pass into history
as typical &ldquo;fish stories,&rdquo; were they not vouched
for by the sober record of official dispatches, and the
unerring evidence of photographer Haynes' camera.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
The elaborate equipment of this expedition, the eminent
character of its <i>personnel</i>, and the evident responsibility
resting upon those who conducted it, attracted
a great deal of attention at the time, and gave
it a prominent place in the annals of Western
Wyoming.<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AN_40" id="Footnote_AN_40"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AN_40"><span class="label">[AN]</span></a> The
year 1883 seems to have been the banner year for distinguished
visitors to the Park. The list of arrivals for that year
includes the President of the United States and a member of his
cabinet; the Chief-Justice and an Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court; the General, Lieutenant-General, and a
large number of other distinguished officers of the army; six
United States Senators; one Territorial Governor; a prominent
railroad president; the Ministers from Great Britain and Germany;
the President of the Admiralty Division of the High
Court of Justice, England; three members of Parliament; and a
considerable number of other eminent personages, both from this
country and abroad.</p></div>

<a href="#bibl_66">Appendix E</a>&mdash;&ldquo;A Journey through the Y. N. P., etc.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>To these various expeditions must be added the extensive,
though desultory, explorations of P. W. Norris
during the five years that he was Superintendent
of the Park.</p>

<p>It has thus come about that the Yellowstone National
Park, though remote, inaccessible, and of great
extent, is about the most thoroughly explored section
of the United States. Within the territory bounded
by the 44th and 45th parallels of latitude, and the
110th and 111th meridians of longitude, there are
nearly four hundred geographical names. The names
of hot springs and geysers would probably double the
number. To appreciate this fact, it must be remembered
that there are no settlements in the Park, and
that counties, townships, cities, and villages, which on
ordinary maps form so large a proportion of the
names, are here entirely absent. That region has indeed
been a paradise for the explorer, the topographer,
and the geologist; and its splendid opportunities have
not gone unimproved.</p>

<p>Although not strictly in the line of original exploration,
the few winter journeys that have been made
through the Park may nevertheless most appropriately
be considered in this place, reserving for a later chapter
a description of the difficult and hazardous nature
of these undertakings. The first of these expeditions
was in 1887, under the auspices of the <i>New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
World</i>, and was led by Frederick Schwatka, the Arctic
explorer. It was organized on a grand scale,
&ldquo;with Arctic &lsquo;sleeping bags,&rsquo; the Norwegian &lsquo;ski,&rsquo;
the Canadian &lsquo;web&rsquo; snow shoe, and toboggans to
carry supplies, photographic equipment, and astronomical
instruments.&rdquo; But the elaborate outfit proved
fatal to the enterprise, which quickly resulted in a
magnificent failure. The conditions were different
from those in Arctic travel, and the recent fall of
light snow negatived any attempt to move toboggans
through it successfully. The party consumed three
days in getting to Norris, a distance of twenty miles.
Here Lieutenant Schwatka became ill and the expedition
was abandoned.</p>

<p>But Mr. F. J. Haynes, the well known Park photographer,
who had accompanied the party, resolved to
continue the tour in order to secure a collection of
winter views. Three other members of the party joined
him. They abandoned the toboggan and strapped the
baggage on their backs. They went by way of the
usual route to the Upper Geyser Basin, where they
were snow-bound for five days in a fearful blizzard.
Thence they went to the Grand Cañon, and from
that point over Mount Washburn to Yancey&rsquo;s. On
this part of the trip the party nearly lost their lives,
wandering for three days in a blinding storm without
food or shelter. The circuit covered about two
hundred miles, and the temperature ranged from ten
to fifty-two degrees below zero during the entire trip
of twenty-nine days.</p>

<p>In March, 1894, two very important winter expeditions
were made in the Park. Mr. F. J. Haynes went
through for the purpose of extending his line of winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
views, and also of photographing the Park game.
Accompanying him was Felix Burgess, government
scout.</p>

<p>Following this party by a few days, and joining it

<p class="caption2">AN INDIAN CAMPAIGN THROUGH THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.</p>


<p>In a letter dated at Fort Ellis, Montana Territory,
August 19, 1877, addressed to the Hon. George W.
McCreary, Secretary of War, the writer, General W.
T. Sherman, then on a tour of inspection of the
&ldquo;country north of the Union Pacific Railroad,&rdquo; tells
of his recent visit to the Yellowstone National Park.
This was about the period when our Indian wars in
the Far West were at their height. Only a year had
elapsed since the Custer massacre. It was the crisis
of the Indian military question. There was at that
time scarcely a spot in the whole Missouri and Yellowstone
Valleys that was safe from Indian depredations.
Naturally, therefore, General Sherman had his
mind upon this subject when his small party, comparatively
unprotected, were traveling through the
wilds of the National Park. But he saw nothing
there to excite his fears, and in the letter above referred
to, says: &ldquo;We saw no signs of Indians and
felt at no moment more sense of danger than we do
here.&rdquo; It will presently be seen how delusive was
this fancied security, and by how narrow a margin it
escaped resulting disastrously to the General&rsquo;s party.</p>

<p>The tour from Fort Ellis to the Park and return
had taken from August 4th to August 18th. On the
latter date, the party met an ingoing company of
tourists from Helena composed of the following persons:
A. J. Weikert, Richard Dietrich, Frederic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>k
Pfister, Joseph Roberts, Charles Kenck, Jack Stewart,
August Foller, Leslie Wilke, L. Duncan, and Benjamin
Stone (colored cook). The party followed the
usual route to the Grand Cañon and Falls of the Yellowstone,
where they were in camp August 24th.</p>

<p>As they were entering the territory of the Park,
another party was on the point of leaving it after a
tour of about two weeks. This party was composed
of the following persons, most of whom were from
Radersburg, Montana: George F. Cowan and wife,
Frank and Ida Carpenter, brother and sister of Mrs.
Cowan, Charles Mann, William Dingee, Albert Oldham,
A. J. Arnold, and a Mr. Meyers. They had
formed a permanent camp in the Lower Geyser Basin,
where the Fountain Hotel now stands, and from that
point had made daily short excursions to the various
localities of interest. They all visited the geyser
basins and some of the party crossed to the Lake and
Cañon of the Yellowstone. They must have been
seen by Sherman&rsquo;s party, for they were directly in his
route. The party had completed their tour of the
Park, August 23d, and had arranged to set out for
home early on the following morning.</p>

<p>In order to understand the unfortunate turn which
the affairs of these two tourist parties were about to
take, it will be necessary to explain, in briefest outline,
the cause and previous incidents of one of the
most remarkable Indian campaigns in our history.</p>

<p>From the time of Lewis and Clark, the Nez Percé
Indians had dwelt in what are now the States of Oregon,
Washington, and Idaho. Their territory extended
from the Salmon River on the south to the
Pelouse River on the north, and from the Bitter Root
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Mountains westward into the present States of Idaho
and Washington. In 1855, they ceded to the United
States a part of their territory, and the principal chiefs
located in the several portions of the remainder. In
1860, gold was discovered on the reservation and the
usual gold rush followed. The danger of a conflict
with the Indians became so great that a temporary
arrangement, pending action by the government, was
made between them and their Indian agent, opening
a portion of the reservation &ldquo;to the whites in common
with the Indians for mining purposes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the settlers did not stop with these concessions.
In defiance of law, they built the town of Lewiston
on the reservation, and gave other proofs of their project
for permanent occupancy. It soon became necessary
for the government to take some decisive step,
and this was accomplished in 1863 by a new treaty in
which the Indians relinquished three of their most
important valleys, the Wallowa, the Alpowai, and the
Salmon River.</p>

<p>The treaty, however, was far from receiving the general
assent of all the chiefs. A formidable faction,
headed by Chiefs Joseph, Looking Glass, Big Thunder,
White Bird, and others, refused to be bound by it, and
were henceforth referred to in official reports as the
&ldquo;Non-treaty Nez Percés.&rdquo; For a time the authorities
made no effort to enforce the new treaty, and the Indians
were &ldquo;tacitly permitted to roam&rdquo; over their
ancient hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs continued for thirteen
years with various efforts in the meantime to arrive
at some more satisfactory settlement. Finally, in 1876,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a civil and military commission was appointed to visit
the Nez Percé Indians, to examine into their grievances,
and to determine what measures were necessary
for a permanent settlement of the question. The
report<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a>
of this Commission is interesting, both for the
facts it relates in regard to the tribal life and characteristics
of the Nez Percé Indians, and for the heroic
treatment of the long-standing troubles which it recommends.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AQ_43" id="Footnote_AQ_43"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AQ_43"><span class="label">[AQ]</span></a> See
Report of Secretary of the Interior, 1877, part 1, p. 607.
See also <a href="#bibl_80">Appendix E</a>, &ldquo;Nez Percé Indians,&rdquo; etc.</p></div>

<p>These Indians were altogether a peculiar people.
The early missionaries had converted them to the
Christian faith, and, whether from that cause, or from
natural proclivity, they were among the most religious
of our Indian tribes. There is a general concensus of
authorities that, despite certain grave defects of character,
they were, mentally and morally, far above the
average Indian. In later times, approaching the period
covered by this sketch, they fell under the influence
of a class of mystics called &ldquo;dreamers,&rdquo; who
taught a doctrine of land ownership which was the
immediate cause of all their subsequent troubles.
This doctrine was, in substance, that &ldquo;the &lsquo;Creative
Power,&rsquo; when he made the earth, made no marks, no
lines of division or separation, upon it, and that it
should be allowed to remain as it is;&rdquo; that it &ldquo;should
not be disturbed by man, and that any cultivation of
the soil, or other improvements, any voluntary submission
to the control of government,&rdquo; were incompatible
with the true purpose for which it was made.
At bottom it was the broad principle that no man or
aggregation of men can take from other men the right
to enjoy what nature has made free for all. Why the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Commission should characterize this doctrine as &ldquo;pernicious,&rdquo;
unless a thing is pernicious whenever it is
impracticable, is not easy to understand. From the
point of view of the nomadic life of the redmen, it is
hard to conceive a theory of land tenure, or the want
of it, more nearly approaching a perfect ideal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for such a doctrine, at the point at
which American history had now arrived, it was no
longer possible of realization; and any attempt to put
it in force could not result otherwise than in failure.
So it was with Joseph and his followers. The government
for a long time overlooked their infractions
of the Treaty of 1863, but finally was compelled to
interfere. The Commission recommended that the
existing treaty be enforced, by military aid if necessary.
The recommendation was approved, and to
General O. O. Howard fell the task of putting the
Indians on their proper reservation.</p>

<p>For a time it seemed that they would be induced to
submit without the employment of active force; but
just as success was apparently assured, the Indians
murdered some twenty white men, women, and children,
in revenge for one of their number killed the
previous year. Peaceful negotiations came at once to
an end, and the military authorities assumed control
of the situation. This was June 13, 1877.</p>

<p>Between that date and July 12th, three battles
were fought, in which both sides suffered severely,
and the Indians displayed extraordinary fighting
ability. They then left their country&mdash;as it proved,
not to return&mdash;and set out across the mountains to
their oft-visited &ldquo;buffalo country,&rdquo; in the Judith Basin,
far to the eastward of the Upper Missouri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>But their route lay too close to the military post of
Fort Missoula and to the towns in the more thickly
settled portions of Montana. They bore off to the
southward, through a country with whose people
they were well acquainted, and with whom they had
often traded in previous excursions to the buffalo
country. Here they found friends and obtained the
supplies they needed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, General Gibbon, with a small
force, which he had gathered from Forts Benton,
Shaw, and Missoula, and from volunteers among
Montana citizens, was in close pursuit. He overtook
the Indians on the Big Hole River, in South-western
Montana, where a desperate battle ensued, in which
his own force was severely handled.</p>

<p>The Indians then passed south into Idaho, with
Howard in pursuit, swung around to the east, and re-crossed
into Montana by way of Henry Lake. Near
Camas Creek, they had an engagement with the pursuing
troops.</p>

<p>Howard arrived at Henry Lake at 8 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, August
23d, just as the Indians had left. The long marches
compelled him to halt at this point for three or four
days, to rest his men and replenish his supplies. This
gave the Indians a considerable start, of which, however,
they took only a leisurely advantage. Their
route lay across the Yellowstone Park, which they entered
by Targhee Pass, and on the night of August
23d they encamped on the Firehole River, in the
Yellowstone National Park, a short distance from
where we left the Radersburg tourists, and less than
twenty miles from the camp of the Helena party.
The interest of the campaign for the next week centers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
chiefly upon the fortunes of these unlucky excursionists.</p>

<p>Before sunrise on the morning of August 24th,
Arnold and Dingee, who had got up to prepare the
camp fire, saw Indians approaching. The rest of the
party were promptly aroused. The Indians at first
professed to be friendly and little alarm was felt; but
the party nevertheless had no appetite for breakfast,
and immediately broke camp and started down the
river toward home. But they were soon surrounded
by the increasing number of Indians, who began to
give indications that trouble was at hand. They were
told that it would be unsafe to proceed down stream
further, that the only course was to turn back with the
Indians. This they were soon forced to do. After
traveling some two miles up Nez Percé Creek, it became
impossible to take the wagons further. The
horses were unhitched and the ladies mounted upon
them, and in this manner the march was resumed. At
this point Mr. Frank Carpenter was induced to hasten
to the front in search of Chief Looking Glass to see if
he could not secure the party&rsquo;s release; but his suspicions
becoming soon aroused, he refused to go
further, and returned. In fact, it turned out later
that Looking Glass was not in front at the time and
that the pretense that he was, was a mere subterfuge
to aid in scattering the party. The captives were
now taken up the East Fork of the Firehole (Nez
Percé Creek) to the foot of Mary Mountain, where
a consultation with the chiefs was had. Mr. Cowan
was spokesman for the whites, and Poker Joe, who
knew English well, for the Indians. The party were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
here set at liberty, their horses, guns and ammunition
were taken, they were given other horses instead, and,
just as the Indians were about to resume their march,
they were told to depart by the back trail. After
proceeding some three-fourths of a mile, they were
overtaken by some seventy-five young and war-painted
bucks, and were compelled to countermarch. It was
about this time that two of the party were given a hint
by a friendly Indian and made their escape in the brush.
The rest continued their way back to the point where
they had been liberated and some distance beyond in
the direction of Mary Lake. Just as they reached
the first sharp ascent of the mountain about 2 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>,
in the midst of dense timber, the attack began. At
the first fire Cowan was struck in the thigh and fell
from his horse. His wife instantly rushed to his side,
threw her arms around his neck, and strenuously resisted
the Indians in their further attempts to kill
him. But they partially pulled her away and an
Indian shot Cowan again in the head. He was then
left for dead.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Carpenter had had a narrow
escape. A young Indian had drawn his revolver
upon him, when Carpenter, remembering his religion,
quickly made a sign of the cross. He was then hid
by the Indians in a clump of underbrush until the
trouble was over, and was assured that the ladies
should not be harmed.<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AR_44" id="Footnote_AR_44"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AR_44"><span class="label">[AR]</span></a> The
Indians denied that Carpenter was saved because of
making a sign of the cross although they remembered his making
it. The chiefs had strictly enjoined their followers that the
whites were not to be injured. When the few lawless bucks
began the attack, some of the other Indians interfered. Poker
Joe was sent back by the chiefs for the same purpose when they
surmised what was going on. He succeeded in preventing further
trouble, and Carpenter&rsquo;s escape was due to this cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The other members of the party scattered promptly
when the firing began. All of them escaped to the
brush, but one of them was wounded in the attempt,
and fell behind a log where he lay concealed
until the Indians had gone.</p>

<p>This left Carpenter and his two sisters captive.
They were taken along with the Indians, each being
lashed to a pony behind an Indian. The captives
became separated and did not see each other until ten
o&rsquo;clock that night at the Indian camp near Mary
Lake. The next day, August 25th, the march was
resumed, and the party were taken across the Yellowstone
at the ford near Mud Geyser. Here Carpenter&rsquo;s
fate was put to a vote of the chiefs and by a majority
of one he was given his life. In the afternoon, the
ladies were given each a pony, and, with Carpenter,
were escorted by Poker Joe back across the river.
They were then taken a mile down stream and told
to depart&mdash;instructions which they obeyed with no
want of alacrity.</p>

<p>Strange to say none of the party had been killed.
Cowan, who had been twice shot, and stoned also by
the Indians, when they saw lingering evidences of
life, nevertheless survived. About five o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon he recovered consciousness, and drew himself
up by the bow of a tree, when lo! close behind him
was another Indian with his rifle ready to fire. He
tried to get away, but the Indian fired and the ball
passed through his left hip. He now gave up hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as he fell again to the ground. The Indian, however,
did not come up. After waiting until every one had
apparently gone, Cowan crawled along till about midnight,
seeking a place of greater safety, and then
waited for day. At daybreak he commenced crawling
back toward the old camp, a distance of eight or ten
miles. He passed the abandoned wagons on the way,
where he found a dog belonging to the party. It took
him four days to reach the old camp, but once there
he found matches, coffee, and some other articles
which helped him to keep alive. The day after his
arrival, he was picked up by Howard&rsquo;s scouts.</p>

<p>Arnold, who had escaped to the brush before Cowan
was shot, and had wandered for four days until finally
picked up by Howard&rsquo;s command near Henry Lake,
came along with the troops on the 29th, and remained
with Cowan until their arrival in Bozeman. They
were taken by Howard to near Baronett&rsquo;s Bridge, and
then sent down the river.</p>

<p>Already Carpenter and his sisters had made their
way down the river, passing close to the camp of the
other party of tourists near the Falls&mdash;whom they
might have saved had they chanced to see them&mdash;and
were met by a party of soldiers under Lieutenant
Schofield twelve miles from Mammoth Hot Springs.
They were escorted to the springs, whence they went
to Bottler&rsquo;s ranch, some distance below the Park, and
a short time afterward returned to Radersburg. It
was about two weeks before Mrs. Cowan learned that
her husband was still alive. After all these miraculous
escapes, it is interesting to know that Mr. Cowan and
his wife survived to make another tour of the Park a
few years later under better conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>It will not be necessary to follow in detail the fortunes
of the rest of the party. They all escaped,
though with much suffering, in their wanderings
through the wilderness.</p>

<p>When the captive members of the party were being
marched down the Yellowstone slope east of Mary
Lake, they heard considerable firing in the timber to
their right. This is thought to have been an attack
upon two prospectors who were known to have been
in the neighborhood at the time, and who have never
since been heard of.</p>

<p>The party of Helena tourists in camp near the Falls
of the Yellowstone on the night of August 24th, were
less fortunate than the Radersburg party. On the
morning of the 25th, they started up the river toward
the Mud Geyser. They had gone about a mile beyond
Sulphur Mountain when they discovered moving
bodies of men, part of whom were fording the river.
Careful scrutiny showed them to be Indians, and the
party rightly divined that they must be the hostile Nez
Percés. They hastily retraced their steps and went
into camp in the timber near the forks of Otter Creek,
about a mile and a half above the Upper Falls of the
Yellowstone. Here they remained undisturbed all
day and the following night. On the morning of the
26th, Weikert and Wilkie set out to scout the country.
They went as far as Sulphur Mountain, and finding
every thing clear, started back to camp to report.
When entering the timber just north of Alum Creek,
they suddenly met a band of Indians who promptly
opened fire on them. A flight and pursuit of considerable
duration ended in the escape of both men; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
not until Weikert had been wounded. This party of
Indians had just attacked and dispersed the group in
camp. They had stolen upon the camp as dinner
was being prepared, and a volley of musketry was the
first warning the tourists had of their presence. There
was instant flight and most of the party managed to
get away. But Kenck was soon overtaken and killed;
and Stewart after being severely wounded, prevailed
on the Indians to spare his life.</p>

<p>Weikert and Wilkie, who had hastened back to
camp after their own encounter, found every thing in
confusion, and all the party gone. They soon fell in
with several of them, and together they set out for
Mammoth Hot Springs.</p>

<p>And now began another series of wanderings through
the trackless wilderness of the Park. Two of the
party made their way by way of the Madison River,
where they were given food by soldiers, to Virginia
City and thence to Helena. The rest of the survivors
after much hardship reached Mammoth Hot Springs,
and soon after left the Park with the exception of
Weikert, Dietrich, the colored cook, Stone, and a man
named Stoner.</p>

<p>On August 31st, Weikert and one McCartney, owner
of the first hotel ever built in the Park, went to the
Falls of the Yellowstone in order if possible to learn
the fate of the missing members of the party. Shortly
after their departure from the Springs a band of
Indians prowled across the country from the Yellowstone
to the Gardiner and went down the latter stream
as far as Henderson&rsquo;s Ranch near the present town of
Cinnabar. After a brief skirmish and a general pillage
here, they went back to Mammoth Hot Springs. Stoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and the colored cook fled precipitately, but Dietrich,
believing the Indians to be friendly scouts, remained
behind and was shot dead in the door of the hotel.
Stone made a lucky escape by climbing a tree, and
his subsequent ludicrous recital of his experience became
a standing jest among the inhabitants of the
Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Weikert and McCartney went back to the old camp
on Otter Creek, where they buried Kenck&rsquo;s remains
and gathered up whatever of value the Indians had
left. On their way back, when on the head waters of
Black Tail Deer Creek, they met the band of Indians
who had just slain Dietrich at Mammoth Hot Springs.
A lively skirmish ensued, in which Weikert lost
his horse. The two men succeeded in finding refuge
in some neighboring brushwood.</p>

<p>Just as the Indians went into camp on the night of
August 23d, their first day in the Park, they captured
one Shively who was on his way to Montana from the
Black Hills. As Shively professed to know the country,
which the Nez Percés had never seen before, they
impressed him into their service as guide. He was
with them thirteen days and claims to have served
them faithfully, as well as to have received fair treatment
from them. At any rate he won their confidence
by his behavior, and was watched so carelessly that he
escaped one dark night just as the Indians were crossing
the north-east boundary of the Park.</p>

<p>As soon as the command at Henry Lake had become
recuperated, the pursuit was vigorously resumed.
Howard followed in the track of the Indians as far as
to the ford of the Yellowstone; but instead of crossing
at this point, he descended the river by the left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bank to the site of Baronett&rsquo;s celebrated first bridge
over the Yellowstone. From the Lower Geyser Basin
to this bridge a road had to be opened for the wagons.
It was a prodigious undertaking, but was performed
with astonishing rapidity under the direction of Capt.
W. F. Spurgin, Twenty-first Infantry. The bridge
was found partially destroyed by the Indians and had
to be repaired, after which the line of march was
continued up the Lamar and Soda Butte Valleys, and
across the divide to the valley of Clark&rsquo;s Fork.</p>

<p>The authorities had been widely warned of the
probable route of the Indians and were lying in wait
to intercept them. Gen. Sturgis expected to do this
as they emerged from the Absaroka Mountains;
but unfortunately he stationed himself in the wrong
pass and left the one which the Indians took unguarded.
By this loss of time he fell in behind both
the Indians and Howard, who was now in close pursuit.
The Indians crossed the Yellowstone September
12th. Here Sturgis overtook them with a company
of cavalry and a slight conflict ensued. The Indians
then struck north, apparently for the British line.
On September 23d they crossed the Missouri at Cow
Island and resumed their march north. But they
were intercepted by Gen. Miles in the Bear Paw
Mountains and a severe fight followed, at the northern
base of the range on Snake Creek, less than thirty
miles from the boundary. The Indians were utterly
defeated and Looking Glass was killed. Most of the
survivors surrendered unconditionally and the rest
escaped across the line. This was on October 5,
1877.</p>

<p>Since the first outbreak, June 13th, three months and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
twenty-two days had elapsed. The flight and pursuit
had extended over 1,500 miles. There had been no
fewer than fifteen engagements. The whites had lost
6 officers and 121 soldiers and citizens killed, and 13
officers and 127 soldiers and citizens wounded. A
large part of the Indian losses could never be ascertained,
but their known losses were 151 killed, 88
wounded and 489 captured.</p>

<p>This celebrated campaign is well intended to elicit
the fullest sympathy for the unfortunate Nez Percés.
A vast deal of sentiment has been wasted upon the
cause of the red man. Opinions have ranged from
the extreme views of Catlin, who could see no wrong
in the Indian, to those of the rabid frontiersman
whose creed was &ldquo;no good Indian but a dead one.&rdquo;
But, if there ever was a case where sympathy might
well incline to the side of the Indian, it is the one
under consideration.</p>

<p>The Nez Percés had always been friendly to the
whites, and it was their boast that they had never
slain a white man. They were intelligent, brave, and
humane. In this campaign they bought supplies which
they might have confiscated; they saved property
which they might have destroyed; they spared hundreds
of lives which other Indians would have sacrificed.
If some of the more lawless element committed
various outrages, they might justly reply that the
whites had fired into their tents where their women
and children were sleeping. In short, their conduct
in this campaign places them in all respects vastly
nearer the standard of civilized people than any other
of the native tribes of the continent.</p>

<p>In estimating the causes that led to the war, history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
can not fail to establish that the Indians were in the
right. It was a last desperate stand against the inevitable
destiny which was robbing the Indian of his
empire; a final protest against the intolerable encroachments
of the pale face. In defense of this principle,
the Nez Percés staked their all on a single
throw. They lost, and were irretrievably ruined.
They were transported to a distant territory, and the
land of their fathers they saw no more.<a name="FNanchor_AS_45" id="FNanchor_AS_45"></a>

the surrender, Joseph and a few of his followers were
sent to Fort Leavenworth, where they remained until July, 1878,
when they were taken to the Indian Territory. After languishing
here for seven years, they were established on the Colville Reservation
in Washington.</p></div>

<p>The campaign of 1877 was the only one in which
tourists of the National Park were ever subjected to
serious danger from the Indians. It has left its mark
indelibly upon the Park. &ldquo;Nez Percé Creek&rdquo; will always
remind the traveler of the terrible danger in
which another party of tourists was once placed upon
the borders of that stream. &ldquo;Howard&rsquo;s Trail&rdquo; will
not soon be effaced from the forests and mountains
where Captain Spurgin, with brilliant expedition,
built the first passable highway through that tangled
wilderness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1878, there was a slight alarm in the Park
caused by an ephemeral raid of the Bannock Indians;
but, beyond the loss of a few horses, no damage was
done.</p>

<p class="caption2">ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY OF THE PARK.</p>


<p>The Act of Dedication of the Yellowstone National
Park indicates in clear terms the purposes for which
it was created. These are:</p>

<p>(1.) The preservation of its natural curiosities, its
forests, and its game.</p>

<p>(2.) The reservation of its territory from private occupancy
so that it may remain in unrestricted freedom
&ldquo;for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(3.) The granting of such leases and other privileges
as may be necessary for the comfort and convenience
of visitors.</p>

<p>One grave omission in the original act, and the long-continued
failure of Congress to remedy it by subsequent
legislation, in a large degree nullified these important
purposes. Strange as it may seem, for twenty-two
years, or until the spring of 1894, there was no
law defining offenses in the Park or providing a penalty
for their commission. Wanton vandalism, destruction
of game, or burning of forests, could be
visited with no heavier punishment than ejection from
the Park and confiscation of &ldquo;outfit.&rdquo; In the reports
of every Superintendent, for more than a score of
years, this condition of affairs was brought to the attention
of Congress. Meanwhile there were experienced
all the evils of a license which at times
was wholly unchecked and which has never until very
recently been under proper control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>This long-standing misfortune was aggravated by
another scarcely less serious&mdash;the failure of Congress
for several years to appropriate funds for the protection
and improvement of the Park. For this failure,
however, no one can justly be held faultily responsible.
The promoters of the Park project had
based extravagant expectations upon the results to be
derived from leases. They believed that the revenue
from this source would amply cover the expense of
opening the necessary highways and providing a
proper police force. They did not make due allowance,
for the fact that there was at that time no railroad
within 500 miles; that the new reservation was
an almost impassable wilderness, and that the construction
of roads and bridges must necessarily precede
any profitable tourist business. Neither do they
seem to have realized that these leases could not, in
the nature of things, yield a revenue commensurate
with the work of opening up so wild and extensive a
country. The argument of self-support was a mistaken
one. It did an important work, however, for it
is doubtful if Congress would have created this reservation
had it not believed that no additional public
burden was to be incurred thereby.</p>

<p>The subsequent results of this erroneous impression
were in every way unfortunate. It was several years
(1872 to 1878) before any money was appropriated for
the Park, which, in the meanwhile, was left wholly
without means for its improvement and protection.
The Secretary of the Interior might indeed publish
rules and regulations for its government, but they
could avail but little so long as there was no authority
to carry them into execution. In fact, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
only valuable result of the creation of the Park during
these years was the exclusion of settlers from its
territory.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Park was created, the Hon. N. P.
Langford was appointed its first Superintendent. The
selection was in every sense an admirable one. Mr.
Langford had been a member of the famous Washburn
Expedition, and an earnest worker in securing
the Act of Dedication. He was intimately acquainted
with all phases of western life, and was an enthusiast
upon the subject of his new charge. But, from the
first, his hands were completely tied. No money was
ever allowed him for his services, nor for any other
form of expenditure in the interests of the Park. He
was, therefore, powerless to accomplish effective work.
His office, which he held for about five years, was a
source of great annoyance to him; for he was frequently,
and most unjustly, charged in the public
press with the responsibility for a condition of things
for which he was in no sense to blame.</p>

<p>In 1877, there appeared, as Mr. Langford&rsquo;s successor,
one of the most unique and picturesque, as
well as one of the most important, characters in the
history of the Park. This was Philetus W. Norris,
of Michigan. He was appointed immediately upon
the advent of President Hayes' administration, and
held office very nearly five years, or almost exactly the
same length of time as his predecessor.</p>

<p>Norris filled with varying capacity the rôles of explorer,
path-finder, poet, and historian in the Park.
He was a man of extraordinary energy, and, if not in
the fullest sense a practical man, he had at least the
invaluable quality of being able to produce results.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
He entered upon his new field of duty with a genuine
enthusiasm, and he was fortunate in receiving from
Congress substantial means with which to carry out
his plans.</p>

<p>The work of Norris' administration may be conveniently
considered under three heads: his discoveries,
his road building, and his reports.</p>

<p>He was pre-eminently an explorer. He not only
traveled repeatedly over all the known trails, but
he penetrated the unknown sections of the Park in
every direction. Though not the discoverer, he first
made generally known the geyser basin that bears his
name. He explored and reported upon the Hoodoo
region, and first called prominent attention to the noble
cañon of the Middle Gardiner. But the most important
feature of his explorations was the study he
made of the history and antiquities of the Park. We
owe more to him than to any one else for evidence of
the former presence of white men in that region.
His discoveries also in the matter of prehistoric races
and of early Indian history possess scientific value.</p>

<p>In the rôle of road builder, Norris was a pioneer in
the Park. Before his time, wagons could get up the
Gardiner to Mammoth Hot Springs, and up the Madison
to the Lower Geyser Basin. He opened the way
direct from Mammoth Hot Springs to the Upper
Geyser Basin, from the Lower Basin to the Yellowstone
River, Lake, and Falls, and from Mammoth Hot
Springs to Tower Creek. He thus shortened the old
pack-train route by one-third, and foreshadowed the
general road system which Lieutenant Kingman later
formulated into a permanent project of improvement.
As a road engineer, he was not a distinguished success.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
His work was ill-conceived and poorly executed,
but at the same time it gave access to many
places wholly inaccessible before. All the difference
between poor roads and none at all may justly be
placed to his credit.</p>

<p>The third and most important feature of Norris'
work was his official reports and other writings. As
he was always doing something, although seldom in
the best way, so he was always saying something,
with the same constitutional defect. Nevertheless, he
has left in his five annual reports a great deal of useful
information, which he supplemented by a long series
of articles in the <i>Norris Suburban</i>, a paper at that
time largely read throughout the West. It is not too
much to say that he was a prime mover in the strong
awakening of public sentiment in regard to the Park
which began to show itself toward the close of his
administration.</p>

<p>Norris' work in the Yellowstone Park can not be
passed over without praise. It left its mark, as its
author did his name, in every quarter. But one
thing must be charged to his account&mdash;an almost
total failure to <i>protect</i> the Park. He did, indeed, by
his public utterances, denounce the vandalism and
game destruction that were then rampant; but he did
little in a practical way to prevent them&mdash;no more, in
fact, than his predecessor, although he was given the
means.</p>

<p>Norris was succeeded in February, 1882, by Patrick
H. Conger, of Iowa. Of this Superintendent, it need
only be said that his administration was throughout
characterized by a weakness and inefficiency which
brought the Park to the lowest ebb of its fortunes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and drew forth the severe condemnation of visitors
and public officials alike. This administration is an
important one, however, for it marks the period of
change in public sentiment already referred to, and
the commencement of reform in the government of
the reservation.</p>

<p>As if the unfortunate condition of affairs due to the
lack of suitable laws for the reservation were not
enough, there arose in the early part of Superintendent
Conger&rsquo;s administration a new and even more
formidable danger, under the euphemistic title of the
Yellowstone Park Improvement Company. Previous
to this time, there had been no regular leases in the
Park. Several informal permits for occupancy had
been granted, and a small number of inferior buildings
had been erected. In 1880, there were nine of
these buildings, nearly all of them being plain log-cabins,
with earth roofs, of the common frontier pattern.
Only two, the headquarters building at Mammoth
Hot Springs and Marshall&rsquo;s Hotel in the Lower
Geyser Basin, rose in dignity above the primitive
type. No one as yet thought of remaining in the
Park during the winter season.</p>

<p>But it finally dawned upon certain sagacious individuals
that here was a rare opportunity to exploit
the government for their private emolument under the
generous guise of improving the Park, and catering
to the comfort of the tourist. A company was accordingly
formed, and a valuable ally secured in the
person of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, who
granted a lease of 4,400 acres in tracts of about a
square mile at each of the great points of interest.
It was urged in defense of this sweeping grant, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
it was hoped in that way to secure the protection
which had yet failed to be found by any other method.
It was thought that, if responsible parties could be
given exclusive control of these natural curiosities,
they would, at least from motives of self-interest, preserve
them. But such a monopolistic privilege was
clearly opposed to the spirit of the Act of Dedication.
Why set apart this region for the free and unrestricted
enjoyment of the people, if the Secretary of the Interior
could give to private parties absolute control of
all its most important localities? Was this a proper interpretation
of &ldquo;small parcels of ground,&rdquo; as specified
in the act? The danger involved in this action was
indeed a grave one, and it at once aroused a storm of
protest throughout the country.</p>

<p>It was about this time also that there began to appear
those various railroad and segregation projects
which from that time to the present have been a formidable
menace to the continued existence of the
Park. A more extensive consideration of this particular
subject is reserved for a later chapter.</p>

<p>It thus became apparent as early as 1882, that immediate
and radical measures must be adopted if the
Park was to be preserved in its original condition.
General Sheridan who passed through that region in
1881, 1882, and 1883, gave forcible warning of the impending
danger, and urgently appealed to the public
sentiment of the country in favor of some action which
should avert it. The Governor of Montana made an
earnest appeal to Congress. Other influential voices
united in the same cause, and already it was broadly
hinted that the only salvation of the Park lay in turning
it over to the military. The whole matter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
brought prominently before the next Congress, and in
March, 1883, a clause in the Sundry Civil Bill containing
the annual appropriation for the Park, forbade the
granting of leases of more than ten acres to any single
party, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to
call upon the Secretary of War for troops to patrol
the Park, and provided for the employment of ten assistant
superintendents who were to constitute a police
force. Thus was the bold scheme of the Improvement
Company frustrated, and the foundation laid for the
present administrative system. The Secretary of the
Interior, however, seems not to have wished to avail
himself of military assistance, and it was several years
before this provision of the law was put into operation.</p>

<p>It was in this same year that the killing of birds
and animals in the Park, and the taking of fish by any
other method than by hook and line, were absolutely
prohibited. Previously, hunting had been allowed so
far as was necessary to supply the wants of camping
parties&mdash;a concession that practically operated as an
unrestricted license.</p>

<p>The failure of Congress to enact needed legislation
at length became so nearly chronic that relief was
sought in another direction. Nearly all the territory
of the Park, and all its great attractions, were within
the limits of Wyoming. Might it not therefore be
within the province of territorial legislation to furnish
the necessary legal protection? The subject was
agitated, and in the winter of 1884, an act was passed,
designed &ldquo;to protect and preserve the timber, game,
fish, and natural curiosities of the Park,&rdquo; and for
other purposes. The act was very stringent in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
provisions, and clearly indicated the deep-seated nature
of the disease which it has designed to cure. But
it totally failed of its purpose. The attempt at territorial
control of what was really a national institution
was in itself a grave blunder. Then, the officials
chosen to execute the law seem to have been poorly
qualified for the purpose, and to have displayed lamentable
want of tact and moderation. Some of their
arrests were so tyrannical and inexcusable, as to create
universal protest. The spectacle of the assistant superintendents&mdash;federal
officials&mdash;sharing, as informers,
the fines levied by a territorial court, was not designed
to create respect for the new authority. At length
the unpopularity of the law became so extreme, that
it was repealed March 10, 1886.</p>

<p>Although so unwise a measure could not stand, the
first effect of its repeal was to advertise the fact that
the Park was practically without legal protection.
Matters became even worse than before. The common
verdict, as gathered from official reports and
other sources, is that the body of police, styled assistant
superintendents, were notoriously inefficient if not
positively corrupt. They were, for the most part,
creatures of political favoritism, and were totally unused
to the service required of them. Commissioned
as guardians of the rarest natural wonders on the
globe, they not infrequently made merchandise of the
treasures which they were appointed to preserve.
Under their surveillance, vandalism was practically
unchecked, and the slaughter of game was carried on
for private profit almost in sight of the superintendent&rsquo;s
quarters. Already some of the rarer species of
animals had suffered a depletion in numbers from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which they have never recovered; and the prediction
of Prof. Comstock, in 1874, seemed on the point of
realization, that &ldquo;the zoological record of to-day&rdquo;
was about to &ldquo;pass into the domain of the paleontologist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The difficulties that beset the administration of the
Park seem to have been too great for Superintendent
Conger to grapple with successfully, and he resigned,
July 28, 1884. It may at least be said in his favor,
that, weak as his management had been, no charge of
corruption or dishonesty was ever brought against
him.</p>

<p>In his place was appointed, August 4, 1884, Robert
E. Carpenter, of Iowa. Mr. Carpenter&rsquo;s views of the
requirements of his office were clear and positive; and
he promptly set about to carry them into execution.
In his opinion, the Park was created to be an instrument
of profit to those who were shrewd enough to
grasp the opportunity. Its protection and improvement
were matters of secondary consideration. Instead
of remaining at his post during the winter season,
he went to Washington, and there, in concert
with a member of the Improvement Company, very
nearly succeeded in carrying a measure through Congress
by which important tracts upon the Reservation
were to be thrown open to private occupancy. So
confident of success were these conspirators that they
even located claims upon the tracts in question, and
their names appeared on claim notices posted to designate
the localities. Fortunately the measure failed
of passage, but the scandal of Superintendent Carpenter&rsquo;s
conduct led to his prompt removal from
office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day of his removal, May 29, 1885, Colonel
David W. Wear, of Missouri, was appointed to the
vacancy. Colonel Wear appears to have been admirably
fitted for the place. He at once set out to reform
the administration of the Park, and his intelligent and
vigorous measures gave the highest encouragement to
those who had been familiar with the previous condition
of affairs. But, as has often happened before,
and will often happen again, he was made to suffer
for the sins of his predecessors. The bad repute into
which the government of the Park had fallen was not
easily removed, and Congress finally declined to appropriate
money for a protection which did not protect.
The Secretary of the Interior was thus compelled
to call upon the Secretary of War for assistance.
The régime of civilian superintendents passed
away, and that of the military superintendents began.
The change was bitterly opposed by the Secretary of
the Interior and by all who held or hoped to hold
places under the old order; but the sequel quickly
proved the wisdom of this action of Congress. The old
order necessarily felt the evil of our patronage system
of office-holding; but no single act ever went so far to
eliminate this fruitful source of misfortune as the assignment
of the administrative control of the Park to
the officers and soldiers of the army.</p>

<p>August 20, 1886, marks the turning point in the
administrative history of the Reservation. It was
upon that day that Captain Moses Harris, First U. S.
Cavalry, relieved the civilian Superintendent of his
duties, and soldiers supplanted the so-called assistant
Superintendents as a Park police. Henceforth an entirely
new order was to obtain. It was to be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
how much could be accomplished, even in the absence
of laws, toward a vigorous and healthful administration.
Trespassers upon the Reservation were promptly
removed. The regulations were revised and extended,
printed upon cloth, and posted in all parts of the
Park; and their violation was visited with summary
punishment to the full extent of the Superintendent&rsquo;s
authority. Abuses of leasehold rights were searchingly
inquired into and reported to the department.
As soon as this show of real authority was made manifest,
and it became apparent that here was a man
who meant what he said, a great part of the difficulty
was over. Nothing in fact conduces so much to the
infraction of law as a belief in the incompetency or
dishonesty of those delegated to enforce it, and the
removal of this cause was a long step in the right direction.</p>

<p>The Park was particularly fortunate in its first military
Superintendent. Captain Harris possessed in a
marked degree the qualities required for that position.
He was vigorous and uncompromising in suppressing
lawlessness, just and impartial in his rulings, and untiring
in his watchfulness for the public interest.
Although his immediate superior, the Secretary of
the Interior, had strenuously opposed the installation
of the military in the Park, he never failed to pay a
high tribute to the efficiency with which the new Superintendent
performed his duties. In fact, this high
opinion of Captain Harris' services was soon shared
by all who were familiar with the situation. Even
<i>Forest and Stream</i>, whose fidelity to the best interests
of the Park has been a distinguishing feature of that
journal for the past fifteen years, was fain to admit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
although it had regarded the change as impolitic,
that under Captain Harris' guardianship &ldquo;the Park
had been cared for as it never had been before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Harris remained in charge for nearly three
years, and was succeeded, June 1, 1889, by Captain
F. A. Boutelle, First U. S. Cavalry. That the evil of
political interference and private intriguing was not
yet wholly eliminated from the affairs of the Park became
manifest when Captain Boutelle undertook to
enforce the regulations against a prominent employe
of the hotel company. For causes not publicly understood,
he was unexpectedly relieved from duty
January 21, 1891, and Captain George S. Anderson,
Sixth U. S. Cavalry, the present Superintendent, was
assigned in his place.</p>

<p>Going back now to the Yellowstone Park Improvement
Company, the history of that erratic concern
will be briefly traced. It is important first to state,
however, that the conduct of private business in the
Park has, until recent years, been most unsatisfactory.
The Park was long unfortunate in the men who
sought to carry on business within its borders, and
even yet it is not wholly free from the evil of unscrupulous
and dishonest schemers. The strife, backbiting,
struggle to ruin each other, which seemed to
be the chief purpose of those who at first sought government
favors on the Reservation, can be understood
only by those who have seen them, or have gone to
the trouble to examine official correspondence. More
than once has the government made these troubles the
subject of special investigation, although generally
with indifferent results.</p>

<p>The new hotel company had a meteoric career,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
promising great things, but effecting no permanent
improvement except the partial construction of the
Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel. Its fortunes early collapsed,
and the opening of the tourist season of 1885
found the great building in the possession of unpaid
workmen, who held it under a kind of military guard
until their wages should be paid.</p>

<p>This company, and other lesser concerns, gradually
transferred their rights to a new company, called the
Yellowstone Park Association, which is still in operation.
It is largely identified with the Northern Pacific
Railroad, and although it has a practical monopoly of
the tourist business, it has never subjected itself to the
charge of using that monopoly to the disadvantage of
the public. From the old and unsatisfactory condition
of things it has built up a hotel system which,
though incomplete, is far ahead of what could be reasonably
expected in a region so remote from the great
centers of civilization.</p>

<p>It was in the early part of Conger&rsquo;s administration
that the government took up in earnest the question
of road construction. For some years, the public,
thoroughly weary of Norris' roads, had been urging
the necessity of sending an engineer officer to take
charge of that important matter. This agitation bore
fruit in 1883 in the assignment of Lieutenant D. C.
Kingman, of the Corps of Engineers, to the charge
of this work. His tour of duty ran through three
years, and resulted in the greatest improvement to
the road system. He prepared the project which has
served as a basis of all subsequent work, and he did
much toward carrying it into execution. His reports
were especially valuable, not only in matters connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with his particular work, but also those pertaining
to the general welfare of the Reservation.
He was among the first to lift a warning voice against
the grave danger of railroad encroachment, and no
one since his time has presented this matter in a more
convincing light.</p>

<p>The years 1894 and 1895 have brought a radical improvement
to the administrative status of the Park.
May 4, 1894, the long desired code of laws was enacted.
On August 3d of the same year, an act was
passed further regulating the question of leases and
removing the most serious defects of previous legislation.
In the autumn of the same year, the road
work was taken from the charge of a non-resident engineer
with headquarters in St. Paul, and placed in
direct charge of the Superintendent, thus bringing
the entire administrative control under a single head.</p>

<p>These two years have also witnessed a decided check
to the schemes of those who still persist in believing
that the Park was created for their personal aggrandizement.
Strong adverse reports have been submitted,
practically for the first time, by Congressional
Committees against the so-called Segregation project,
the admission of railroads into the Park, and the construction
of an electric railway therein.</p>

<p>With the exception of the lack of a sufficient force
of scouts properly to patrol that region, the condition
of affairs on the Reservation is now eminently satisfactory&mdash;far
more so than at any previous period.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_I_CHAPTER_XV" id="PT_I_CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="caption2">THE NATIONAL PARK PROTECTIVE ACT.</p>


<p>One of the most important milestones in the history
of the Park has been so recently set that the public
is as yet not fully conscious of its existence. It has
already been stated that for more than twenty years
the Park was wholly without adequate statutory
protection; and that this long-standing defect was
finally remedied by the enactment of a comprehensive
measure in the spring of 1894. The circumstances
attending the passage of this Act, and the
prompt manner in which a great misfortune was
changed into a lasting benefit, form one of those
singular instances of good fortune which have so
largely characterized the history of this region.</p>

<p>Bills providing suitable protection for the Park
were introduced at the First Session of the Fifty-third
Congress, just as they have been for the past twenty
years, and apparently with not much greater chance
of success. The wanton recklessness of those who seek
special privileges in the Park, and are unwilling that
any measure for its welfare shall pass unless coupled
with their own private schemes, threatened this time,
as hitherto, to defeat Congressional action. But an
unforeseen event, of such powerful bearing as practically
to override all opposition, occurred in March,
1894, and quickly brought about the desired consummation.</p>

<p>It is well known that the only herd of bison, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
roaming in their native condition within the present
limits of the United States, is in the Yellowstone
National Park. There has always been a lively interest
in the preservation of this herd, and its extinction
would be regarded as a deplorable calamity. With
proper protection, it will undoubtedly flourish, but
there is no margin for carelessness or neglect.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1894, Captain George S. Anderson,
U. S. A., Superintendent of the Park, learned
that snow-shoe tracks had been seen along Astringent
Creek in the Pelican Valley east of the Yellowstone
River, in territory ranged over by the buffalo in
winter. The same tracks were seen near Soda Butte
station pointing toward Cooke City. Inquiry proved
them to have been made by one Howell, a well-known
poacher and lawless character, who was evidently
driving his trade in the winter buffalo country. It
was apparent that he had left the Park for supplies
and would soon return. Captain Anderson accordingly
laid his plans for capture.</p>

<p>There has been given a brief account of the winter
expedition through the Park in the spring of 1894, of
which Mr. F. J. Haynes and Scout Burgess were
members. Burgess was instructed to examine the
country east of the Yellowstone and obtain, if possible,
a clue to Howell&rsquo;s whereabouts. Early on the
morning of March 12th, he set out from the Lake
hotel with a single companion, Private Troike, of the
Sixth Cavalry, and before it was scarcely daylight
struck a dim snow shoe trail in the valley of Astringent
Creek. Soon after, he found the poacher&rsquo;s teepe
and a number of buffalo heads hung up, by means of
a pulley, to the limb of a tree so as to be out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reach of wolves. Every thing indicated that the
poacher was there for a business of some duration and
magnitude.</p>

<p>Leaving the teepe and following Howell&rsquo;s morning
trail for some distance, Burgess' attention was soon
arrested by six rifle reports. These six shots slew five
buffalo. Burgess soon discovered Howell, engaged in
skinning the head of one of the buffalo. His rifle
was leaning against another some fifteen feet from
him. A dog (but this Burgess did not know) was
coiled up under the leg of a buffalo. Burgess thus
had the dangerous duty to perform of crossing the
intervening space of some four hundred yards, where
there was no cover and where he might easily be seen
by Howell or the dog. Considering the desperate
character of these poachers, and the fact that Burgess
was armed only with a revolver as against Howell&rsquo;s
rifle, the peril involved in this capture may be easily
appreciated. But fortune was on Burgess' side. A
heavy storm was on, and the wind was blowing direct
from Howell to Burgess. This prevented the dog from
scenting approach, and Howell from hearing any
noise, from the leeward. Burgess did not stop to
reckon the chances of success, but promptly sallied
forth upon his intended victim. On his way he ran
upon an open ditch about ten feet wide. To make a
snow shoe jump on level ground is a feat of much
difficulty; but Burgess managed to accomplish it. By
good fortune nothing happened to arouse Howell, and
Burgess got within fifteen feet of him before he was
aware that there was any one within as many miles.
With Burgess' cocked revolver over him, he discreetly
surrendered. Private Troike was summoned, the rifle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and accoutrements were seized, and the party set out
at once for the Lake hotel. But such are the difficulties
of snow shoe travel in this region, that it was long
after dark before they reached their destination.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone Park Association keeps a solitary
watchman at each of its hotels during winter, and has
a telephone line connecting each with Mammoth Hot
Springs. By virtue of this lucky fact, Howell&rsquo;s capture,
though made some sixty miles from the nearest
telegraph station, and in a region where winter travel
is impossible except on snow shoes, was made known
to the Superintendent before 9:30 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> that day. By
another stroke of good fortune a representative of <i>Forest
and Stream</i> was at that moment present at Mammoth
Hot Springs. He had arrived but two days before and
remained a guest of the Superintendent prior to a tour
of the Park, which began two days later. The news
of Howell&rsquo;s capture was at once put on the wire, and
in less that twenty-four hours, <i>Forest and Stream</i> was
represented in Washington with a new and powerful
argument for the passage of the Offenses Bill. The
imminent danger of the speedy and entire extinction
of the only remaining herd of buffalo in the country
produced the desired effect in Congress, and on May
7, 1894, the bill became a law.</p>

<p>It was throughout a most fortunate combination of
circumstances that made this consummation possible.
A Superintendent thoroughly devoted to the care of his
important charge, and fearless in the execution of his
duty; a scout who had the nerve to make an arrest
full of peril to himself; the existence of a winter
telephone line to the heart of that inaccessible region;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the presence at Mammoth Hot Springs of a representative
of that journal which holds first rank among
the protectors of the Park; and uncommon good,
luck in minor details, caused this important event to
cast its influence into the national councils almost before
the echo of the poacher&rsquo;s rifle shots had died
away among the mountains. Howell&rsquo;s act was a
misfortune&mdash;a grievous misfortune&mdash;to the game interests
of the Park; but its immediate result in legislation
will prove a benefit of far greater consequence.</p>

<p>Howell was brought to Mammoth Hot Springs and
was there imprisoned in the Fort Yellowstone guardhouse,
and his case reported to Washington. As
there was no law for his trial and punishment, the
Secretary of the Interior in due time ordered his release.
He was accordingly put out of the Park and
forbidden to return without permission. But with his
habitual disregard of authority, he came back during
the following summer and was discovered by the Superintendent
in a barber&rsquo;s chair at Mammoth Hot Springs
Hotel. He was promptly arrested and tried under
the new law for violating the orders of the Superintendent
in returning. He was convicted and sentenced
to one month&rsquo;s imprisonment and fifty dollars
fine. He thus became the Park Haman&mdash;first to be
hanged upon the gallows of his own building.</p>

<p>Howell appealed the case to the U. S. District Court
sitting at Cheyenne, Wyoming, and was released
upon the technical ground that, as the prohibition
against returning to the Park was merely an order
from the Superintendent, and not explicitly authorized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
by the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior,
the offense did not come within the purview of the
law. This defect in the regulations has since been
remedied and the conviction of Howell, therefore,
notwithstanding his final release, has all the force of
precedent.</p>

<p>At the time when the bill creating the Yellowstone
Park was before Congress there had been no detailed
survey of that region, and the boundaries, as specified
in the bill, were to some extent random guesses.
The exploring parties of 1870 and 1871 had seen all
the more important points of interest. To include
these in the proposed reservation, the framers of the
bill passed two lines due east and west, one through
the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner Rivers,
and one through a point ten miles south of the most
southerly point of the Yellowstone Lake; and two lines
due north and south, one through a point ten
miles east of the easternmost point of Yellowstone
Lake, and one through a point fifteen miles west of
the most westerly point of Shoshone (then called
Madison) Lake. The nearly rectangular area thus resulting
was found to lie mainly in the north-west
corner of Wyoming, with narrow strips, two or three
miles wide, overlapping into the Territories of Montana
and Idaho. The mean dimensions of the Reservation
were 61.8 miles by 53.6 miles, giving an area
of 3312.5 square miles.</p>

<p>By presidential proclamation, dated September 10,
1891, a large area to the east and south of the Park
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was set apart as a Forest Reserve, under the provisions
of an Act of March 3, 1891, and was placed in charge
of the Superintendent of the Park. By this action
the area reserved from settlement around the sources
of the Yellowstone was increased to about 5,000
square miles. It should be remembered, however,
that this additional reserve is not a direct creation by
Act of Congress, and it therefore does not stand upon
the same substantial footing as the original Reservation.</p>

<p>The chief topographical features of the Park are as
follows:</p>


<p class="caption3">DRAINAGE AREAS.</p>

<p>Three great rivers receive the waters of the Yellowstone
Park&mdash;the Yellowstone, the Missouri, and the
Snake. The first two rivers are on the Atlantic slope;
the third is on the Pacific slope. The areas drained
by them are approximately:</p>

<table summary="drainage areas">
<tr><td class="tdl">By the Yellowstone,</td><td class="tdr">1,900 square miles.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">By the Missouri,</td><td class="tdr">730 square miles.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">By the Snake,</td><td class="tdr">682 square miles.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Yellowstone River has its source in the snow
drifts of Yount Peak, twenty-five miles south-east of
the Park. It enters the Reservation six miles west of
the south-east corner; crosses it in a direction somewhat
west of north, and leaves it at a point about
nineteen miles east of the north-west corner. Near the
center of the Park it flows through the celebrated
lake of the same name, and further north passes
through two remarkable cañons before it leaves the
Reservation. Its principal tributaries within the Park
are the Lamar River (commonly called the East Fork),
from the east, and Gardiner River from the west.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The Lamar River rises nearly due east of the outlet
of Yellowstone Lake and flows north-westerly, joining
the main stream near Junction Butte. Its principal
tributary is Soda Butte Creek, which rises just outside
the north-east corner of the Park and joins the
Lamar River near the extinct hot spring cone from
which it derives its name.</p>

<p>Gardiner River is the second largest tributary of the
Yellowstone, and drains the extensive area between
the Washburn and Gallatin Mountains.</p>

<p>The low-water discharge of the Yellowstone River,
as measured by the writer, in 1891, a little below the
lake outlet, is 1,598 cubic feet per second; as measured
by the United States Geological Survey, in
1886, 1,525 cubic feet. The discharge at the north
boundary of the Park can not be less than 2,000
cubic feet.</p>

<p>The Missouri River drainage flows into the Gallatin
and Madison forks of that stream. The Gallatin
drains only a small area in the extreme north-west
corner of the Park. The Madison is formed by the
junction of the Gibbon and Firehole Rivers, about
twelve miles east of the west boundary of the Park.
The Gibbon takes its rise a few miles west of the
Falls of the Yellowstone, and flows in a south-west
direction. The Firehole rises in Madison Lake, and
flows north to its junction with the Gibbon. Its
principal tributaries are the Little Firehole River and
Iron Creek on the west, and Nez Percé Creek on the
east.</p>

<p>The Snake River drains the south-west portion of
the Park. It rises about fifteen miles south of Yellowstone
Lake, just outside the Park. It then takes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a northerly circuit into the Park, receiving the waters
of Hart and Lewis Rivers, and leaves the Reservation
just north of Jackson Lake. Its principal tributary
is the Lewis River, which drains Shoshone and Lewis
Lakes. Several large streams, Bechler and Falls Rivers
among them, cross the south-west boundary of the
Park and join the main Snake further south.</p>

<p>The line of separation between this water-shed and
those of the Yellowstone and the Missouri, is the
Continental Divide, the irregular course of which can
be readily understood by consulting the map.</p>

<p>In the entire Park there are about thirty-six named
lakes with a total area of nearly 165 square miles.
Of these lakes, twenty-one, with an area of 143 square
miles, are on the Yellowstone slope; eight, with an
area of perhaps two square miles, are on the Missouri
slope; and seven, with an area of about twenty square
miles, are on the Snake River slope. The four principal
lakes&mdash;Yellowstone, Shoshone, Lewis, and Hart&mdash;are
clustered near the Continental Divide at its lowest
point, the first being on the Atlantic slope, and the
others on the Pacific.</p>

<p>There are upon the various streams of the Park no
fewer than twenty-five interesting water-falls, where
the streams descend from the Park plateau to the
lower surrounding country.</p>


<p class="caption3">MOUNTAIN SYSTEM</p>

<p>As the Yellowstone River is the most important
stream in the Park, so the Absaroka Range, in which
it has its source, is the most important mountain system.
It extends north and south along the entire
eastern border. To the south it is prolonged under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the name of the Sierra Shoshone Mountains as far as
the Wind River Valley, while north of Soda Butte
Creek it extends to the Great Bend of the Yellowstone
under the name Snowy Range. The various
larger summits are remarkably uniform in elevation.
From Index Peak on the north to Yount Peak on the
south, there are more than thirty named mountains
with an average altitude of 10,400 feet. The variation
from this mean is slight. The range, throughout
its length, is full of noble views, and, as seen
from across the Yellowstone Lake, is one of the
finest exhibitions of mountain scenery on the continent.</p>

<p>The next most important range is the Gallatin, situated
in the north-west corner of the Park, at the head
of the Gallatin River. It has about seventeen named
peaks, with an average altitude of 9,800 feet. The
highest peak, Electric, is the loftiest mountain in the
Park.</p>

<p>The Washburn Range, a detached mountain system,
originally known as the &ldquo;Elephant&rsquo;s Back,&rdquo; is situated
between the Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone
and the Gardiner River. It has seven christened
summits, with an average altitude of 9,800 feet. The
most conspicuous peak of the range, as well as the
most noted mountain of the Park, is Mt. Washburn.</p>

<p>The Red Mountain Range is a small, detached
group of mountains between Hart and Lewis Lakes.
Its principal summit, Mt. Sheridan, affords probably
the finest view to be had in that entire region.</p>

<p>The Teton Range lies mainly outside the Park, its
northern spurs barely touching the southern boundary.
It extends north and south along the west shore of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Jackson Lake, and is a very noted range of mountains.
Its highest summit, the Grand Teton, has no
competitor for altitude nearer than Fremont Peak,
seventy-five miles distant.</p>

<p>The Big Game Ridge lies along the south boundary
of the Park, and is the source of the Snake River. It
has six named peaks, with an average altitude of
9,800 feet.</p>

<p>Besides these various groups of mountains, there
are a few detached peaks worthy of note, which can
not be conveniently classified with any of the principal
ranges.</p>


<p class="caption3">PLATEAUS.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the Park area is composed
of what may be termed plateaus, elevated tracts
of land, not so high as the mountain ranges, but much
higher than the valleys. Ordinarily, these are to be
found along the divides between the larger streams.
The more important are the Pitchstone Plateau, between
the Snake River and the head waters of the
Bechler and Fall Rivers, with a mean altitude of 8,500
feet; Highland Plateau, between the Yellowstone and
the Madison Rivers, altitude 8,300 feet; Mirror
Plateau, between the Yellowstone and the Lamar
Rivers, altitude 9,000 feet; <a name="Mt_Everts" id="Mt_Everts"></a>Mt.
Everts Plateau, between
the Yellowstone and the Gardiner, altitude
7,000 feet; and the Madison Plateau, west of the
Lower Geyser Basin, altitude 8,300 feet.</p>


<p class="caption3">VALLEYS.</p>

<p>These form an exceedingly important part of the
Park topography. The largest is Junction Valley, including
its branches along the Yellowstone and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Lamar Rivers. It is an extensive, grassy tract,
stretching well back upon the mountain sides, and
forming a fine pasturage for game. For scientific research,
its fossil forests and other features make it an
extremely interesting section.</p>

<p>Hayden Valley is the next in size and importance,
and occupies an important tract along the Yellowstone
River, between the Lake and Falls, mostly on
the west side, in the vicinity of Alum Creek.</p>

<p>The Madison Valley, and its extensions up the
Firehole and Gibbon Rivers, are chiefly noteworthy
as being the locality of the three great geyser regions
of the Park.</p>

<p>The Swan Lake Flats, Willow Park, the Shoshone
and Falls River Basins, are other important examples
of typical mountain valleys.</p>


<p class="caption3">ALTITUDES.</p>

<p>The lowest point in the Park is at the junction of
the Yellowstone and the Gardiner Rivers, 5,360 feet
above sea level; the highest is the summit of Electric
Peak, six miles distant, 11,155 feet. To give a general
idea of the altitudes of different points in the Park,
particularly of those which the tourist visits, the following

<p class="caption3">SCENERY.</p>

<p>The mountain scenery of the Park is not so imposing
as that of Colorado and some other parts of
the Rocky Mountain region; but it is more varied
and beautiful. The eye is not wearied with the constant
sight of vast and bare mountain cliffs, but finds
relief in attractive lakes, streams, glades, parks, forests,
and every combination of effects that helps to produce
a beautiful landscape.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_II_CHAPTER_II" id="PT_II_CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="caption2">Geology of the Park.</p>


<p>Nature seems, from the first, to have designed this
region for a mountain park. In geological chronology
it was near the close of the Cretaceous Period, that the
lifting of the great mountain systems of the West into
their present positions was practically finished. In
the formation of these mountains, the general outline
of the Yellowstone Park was already marked out,
probably in much more striking features than at present.
A vast rim of mountains, visible now in the Absaroka,
Snowy, Gallatin, Teton, and Snake River
Ranges, hemmed in the extensive area which has
since become so famous. Subsequent events have
greatly modified its original form, but the grand outlines
at first determined are still distinctly visible.</p>

<p>In the Tertiary Period, which was next in order of
time after the Cretaceous, changes of the greatest importance
occurred, consisting principally in the outpouring
of enormous masses of volcanic material. The
origin of these lava flows has been traced to a few
craters, one of which was near Mt. Washburn, another
in the Red Mountain Range, and a third near the
sources of the Lamar River. Mt. Washburn has long
been recognized as part of the rim of an ancient volcano.
Both it and Mt. Sheridan, the two mountains
which bore the principal part in working out the
present features of that country, still remain the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
prominent peaks from which the modern visitor can
contemplate the work they have performed.</p>

<p>The outpourings at first consisted of andesitic lavas.
They largely changed the appearance of the mountain
ranges and to some extent filled up the interior basin.
The flows were not continuous but were separated by
long intervals of quiet, during which vegetation and
the agencies of erosion were actively at work.</p>

<p>After the cessation of the andesitic eruptions, a quiescent
period of great length ensued. Then came the
period of rhyolitic flows, the centers of volcanic activity
being as before Mts. Washburn and Sheridan. These
flows built up the present Park plateau, and constitute
the great bulk of the rocks which the tourist now
sees.</p>

<p>Following the period of rhyolitic eruptions, orographic
agencies were active in producing extensive
faults or displacements, which in certain localities
radically changed the relative positions of the rocks.</p>

<p>The last exhibitions of volcanic energy were in the
form of basaltic eruptions. These took place in part
through ordinary volcanic craters, and in part through
cracks or seams in the rocks, where they may still be
seen forming extensive dykes. The basalt is of
relatively limited extent, but its striking and picturesque
forms wherever it appears make it more interesting
to the tourist than any of the other rocks.</p>

<p>The great variety of superficial appearances which
these volcanic rocks have assumed makes the Park
one of the best laboratories in the world for their
study.</p>

<p>The continuance of these various outpourings doubtless
extended into Quaternary time. Then came the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Glacial Epoch, the epoch of wide-spread ice-carving,
which still further modified the surface of the country.
The paths of the ancient glaciers have in several
instances been made out and their transported material
may readily be distinguished. One glacier
flowed from the Gallatin Range eastward across Terrace
Mountain, where it joined another moving westwardly
from the Absaroka Range. The united
streams continued down the Gardiner and Yellowstone
Valleys, in which vast masses of drift still
mark their ancient route.</p>

<p>Glacial action and the common agents of denudation
have given the Park country its present general
aspect. These later modifications have indeed been extensive,
and the great variety of form now seen in the
valleys, cañons and hills is the result of their combined
action. The Yellowstone Cañon is a marked
example of erosion on a large scale. A direct result
of its formation was the partial draining of Yellowstone
Lake, which had previously existed at a much
higher level than now, and spread over the entire
area of the present Hayden Valley.</p>

<p>Since the cessation of the basaltic lava flows there
seem to have been no further lava outpourings in this
region. The old volcanoes have been long extinct
and their craters have been modified almost beyond
recognition. But evidences of the power which once
worked beneath them are still abundant, although no
longer on so imposing a scale. It is the hot springs
and geysers still in existence which partly render this
region so widely celebrated. That this thermal action
originates mainly in the same source of energy which
once poured out the vast fields of lava, there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
reason to doubt. Many plausible explanations are
advanced to account for the existence of subterranean
heat, but whatever may be its real origin it is doubtless
the same for both classes of phenomena.</p>

<p>The action which is now observable has continued
in an ever-decreasing degree since the close of the
lava period. Over vast tracts of the Park plateau,
the rocks are entirely decomposed to unknown depths
by the ascending superheated vapors. Some idea of
the extent of this action may be obtained at the
Grand Cañon, which has cut its way a thousand feet
downward into the decomposed volcanic rock without
yet reaching its bottom. The infinite variety of
chemic products resulting from this decomposition
has given the Cañon its wonderful coloration.</p>

<p>The same condition largely prevails over the Park
plateau. Where now are dense forests and no superficial
evidence of unusual conditions, there will frequently
be found, by digging beneath the surface, the
familiar proof that thermal activity once prevailed
there. In constructing the tourist route from the
Upper Geyser Basin to the Yellowstone Lake, where
for nearly the whole distance there is a complete absence
of hot springs, the evidences of former volcanic
activity were found to be abundant.</p>

<p>Facts like these clearly demonstrate that, from a
geologic standpoint, thermal activity in the Park is
gradually becoming extinct; and many persons, taking
alarm at this evidence, imagine that the unique phenomena
of the Yellowstone are of an evanescent
character, and that the time is not far remote when
they will be known only as matters of history. There
is, however, no occasion for such misgiving. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
present condition is the result of processes that run
back probably for millions of years; certainly for
periods of time compared with which recorded history
is insignificant. The same rate of progress would
produce no perceptible change in the lifetime of an
individual.</p>

<p>Some who have visited the geyser regions more
than once assert that, after an interval of several
years, they observe a marked diminution in thermal
activity. But this is probably because a second visit
ordinarily makes a less vivid impression than a first.
The weight of reliable evidence is certainly the other
way. Mr. David E. Folsom, leader of the Expedition
of 1869, made a tour of the Park during the present
season of 1895. He says: &ldquo;I had a very vivid recollection
of all I saw twenty-six years ago, and I note
no important change.&rdquo; Professor Arnold Hague, probably
the best living authority upon the scientific features
of the Park, has compared the hot springs and
geysers by means of authentic records covering intervals
of several years, and he declares that he finds &ldquo;no
diminution in the intensity of action or in the amount
of discharge from the springs and geysers, since they
have been subject to careful observation.&rdquo; While it is
certain that springs are constantly becoming inactive,
it is no less certain that others replace them, and it
may be confidently assumed that the progress toward
ultimate extinction will be inappreciable in our time
or for many generations to come.</p>

<p>The distribution of thermal springs over the surface
of the earth is probably more general than is commonly
supposed. Only one extensive area is practically
without them, and that is the Continent of Australia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Africa, also, has very few. But in other parts
of the globe they are found almost without number,
ranging from the Equator to the Arctic Circle, and
from sea-level to the lofty table lands of Thibet.</p>

<p>The three localities, however, in which they abound
in such numbers and magnitude as to attract marked
attention are, in the order of their discovery, Iceland,
New Zealand, and the Yellowstone National Park. In
extent, variety, and magnitude of accompanying phenomena,
and in geologic age, the above order is reversed.
Iceland has probably the most famous geyser
in the world, principally because it was for a long time
the only known geyser, and consequently received a
great deal of scientific attention; but judging from
published descriptions it is clearly inferior to several
now known in the Firehole Geyser Basin.</p>

<p>Three notable features of similarity in these geyser
regions are the presence of volcanic rocks of remote or
recent origin; proximity to the earth&rsquo;s surface of active
sources of subterranean heat; and the presence of a
great number of lakes. In all three cases, lava, heat
and water are the characteristic geologic and physical
accompaniments of those particular phenomena which
will now be described more in detail.</p>

<p class="caption2">GEYSERS.</p>


<p>The hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park
may be roughly divided into two classes, eruptive and
non-eruptive. To the first the term <i>geyser</i> is applied,
while the term <i>hot springs</i> is restricted to the second.
These two classes pass into each other by insensible
gradations and the line of demarcation it is not possible
to draw. The following description will pertain only
to those examples about which there is no doubt, and
which may be taken as types of their class.</p>

<p>A geyser may be defined as a periodically eruptive
hot spring. The name, as might be expected, is of Icelandic
origin, and comes from the verb <i>geysa</i>, <i>to gush</i>.
The general characteristics of a true geyser, as illustrated
by the most perfect example known, Old Faithful
in the Yellowstone Park, are the following:</p>

<p>(1.) There is an irregular tube descending from the
earth&rsquo;s surface to some interior source of heat.</p>

<p>(2.) The mouth of this tube may be either a self-built
mound or cone (as in the example), or simply an
open pool.</p>

<p>(3.) Into this tube meteoric water finds its way and
is subjected to the action of heat.</p>

<p>(4.) The result is an eruption and expulsion of the
water from the tube with more or less violence.</p>

<p>(5.) The eruption is generally preceded by slight
preliminary upheavals leading gradually to the final
outburst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>(6.) After cessation of the eruption there is usually
a considerable escape of steam.</p>

<p>(7.) A quiescent period, generally of indeterminate
duration, follows during which the conditions necessary
for an eruption are reproduced.</p>

<p>Geyser phenomena have attracted a great deal of
scientific attention, and many theories have been advanced
to explain them. Passing over for the present
the various less important views, attention will first be
given to Bunsen&rsquo;s theory, because it is, upon the
whole, the most satisfactory explanation yet advanced.
This theory was a direct deduction from observations
upon the Great Geyser of Iceland, and has been experimentally
illustrated by artificial examples.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle upon which it is based
is the well known fact that the temperature of the boiling
point of water varies with the pressure to which
the water is subjected. At the sea level, under the
pressure of one atmosphere (fifteen pounds to the
square inch), the boiling point is about 212 degrees
Fahrenheit. Under a pressure of two atmospheres it
is 250 degrees; of three, 275 degrees; of four, 293
degrees, and so on. At an altitude like that of the
Park plateau, where the atmospheric pressure is much
less than at sea level, the normal boiling point is about
198 degrees, but the law of variation due to pressure
conditions applies exactly as in lower altitudes.</p>

<p>If water, subjected to great pressure, be heated to a
temperature considerably above that of its normal
boiling point, and if then the pressure be suddenly relieved,
it will almost instantaneously be converted
into steam; a fact which always operates to enhance
the danger from the explosion of steam boilers. Applying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
this principle to the case of an ordinary geyser,
it will readily be seen that in the long irregular
tube descending to great depths there are present the
necessary conditions for subjecting the water to great
pressure. At the surface the pressure is that of the
weight of the atmosphere corresponding to the altitude;
at a certain depth below (33 feet at the sea
level, but less at higher altitudes) it is twice as
great; at double this depth three times as great, and
so on.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that there is an interior heat at some
point along the geyser tube well below the surface.
The boiling point of water in the vicinity of the heat
supply will be higher than at the surface in definite
relation to its distance down. If the tube be of large
diameter and the circulation quite free, the water will
never reach this point, for it will rise nearer the top,
where the boiling point is lower and will pass off in
steam. The spring will thus be simply a boiling or
quiescent spring. But if the tube be comparatively
small and if the circulation be in any way impeded,
the temperature at the source of heat will rise until it
reaches a boiling point corresponding to its depth.
Steam will result, and will rise through the water,
gradually increasing the temperature in the upper
portions of the tube. After a time the water throughout
the entire tube becomes heated nearly to the boiling
point and can no longer condense the steam rising
from below; which then rapidly accumulates until its
expansive power is great enough to lift the column
above and project some of the water from the basin
or cone. This lessens the weight of the column
and relieves the pressure at every point. In places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
where the water had been just below the boiling point,
it is now above, and more steam is rapidly produced.
This throws out more water, still further lightens the
column, and causes the generation of more steam,
until finally the whole contents of the tube are ejected
with terrific violence.</p>

<p>From this explanation it is apparent that any thing
which impedes the circulation of water in the geyser
tube will expedite the eruption. The well-known effect
of &ldquo;soaping geysers&rdquo; may thus be accounted for.
As oil thrown upon waves gives a viscosity to the
surface, which greatly moderates their violence, so
does the addition of soap or lye make the water of
the geyser tube less free to circulate, and thus hasten
the conditions precedent to an eruption.</p>

<p>The apparently contrary process of violently agitating
the water of the geyser, as by stirring it with a
stick, sometimes produces the same effect; but this
results from the sudden forcing upward of masses of
superheated water, instead of allowing them to rise
and gradually cool.</p>

<p>That Bunsen&rsquo;s theory really explains the phenomena
of geyser action there can be little doubt. It is
true that in no single geyser does one find a perfect
example of the theory. But it must be remembered
that typical conditions probably never exist. The
point of application of heat; the mode of application,
whether from the heated surface of rocks or from
superheated steam issuing into the tube; the diameter
and regularity of the tube; the point of inflow of the
cold water; are all matters which influence the eruption
and determine its character. In the endless
variety of conditions in nature one need not wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
at the varying results. He should rather wonder that
in a single instance nature has produced a combination
of such perfection as is found in Old Faithful, which,
for thousands of years has performed its duty with the
regularity of clock work.</p>

<p>There are various other theories, each with some
particular merit, which may be briefly referred to.
Sir George Mackenzie, who visited Iceland in 1810-11,
thought the geyser tube at some point beneath the
surface curved to one side and then upward, communicating
with a chamber in the immediate vicinity
of the source of heat. The water in this chamber
becomes heated above the boiling point, and, expanding,
forces the water from the chamber into the tube
until the chamber is finally emptied to the level of the
mouth of the tube. Any further expulsion of water
lessens the weight of the column of water above.
Bunsen&rsquo;s theory comes into play, and with the accumulated
pressure of the steam in the chamber, produces
a violent eruption.</p>

<p>Prof. Comstock, who visited the Park in 1873,
thought that there were two chambers, the lower
being in contact with the source of heat, and the
upper acting as a sort of trap in the geyser tube.
After a sufficient force of steam has accumulated in
the lower chamber, it ejects the contents of the chamber
above.</p>

<p>S. Baring-Gould, who visited Iceland in 1863, observed
that if a tube be bent into two arms of unequal
length, the shorter of which is closed, and if the tube
be filled with water and the shorter arm then heated,
all the characteristic phenomena of geyser action result,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the water being finally ejected, with explosive
violence from the longer tube.</p>

<p>Now, it is probable that in nature each of these
theories may find illustration, but it must still be
acknowledged that in all cases Bunsen&rsquo;s theory is the
partial explanation, and in many the only adequate
one.</p>

<p>The most superficial examination of the geysers in
the Park will disclose two widely different characteristics
as regards their external appearance and mode
of eruption. On this basis they may be divided into
two classes&mdash;the fountain geysers and the cone
geysers.</p>

<p>In the fountain geyser there is no cone or mound,
but in its place a considerable pool which in intervals
of rest bears perfect resemblance to the larger quiescent
springs. The eruption generally consists of a
succession of prodigious impulses by which vast quantities
of water are thrown up one after another.
There is ordinarily no continuous jet. To geysers of
this class, Mackenzie&rsquo;s and Comstock&rsquo;s theories would
seem to find closer application than to any others.
Noted examples are the Fountain, the Great Fountain,
the Grand and the Giantess Geysers.</p>

<p>The cone geysers, on the other hand, have no pool
about the crater, and water is not generally visible in
the tube. There is always a self-built cone or mound
of greater or less prominence, ranging from a broad
gently-sloping mound, like that of Old Faithful, to a
huge cone like that of the Castle. The eruptions
from these geysers usually take the form of a continuous
jet, and are more in accordance with the theory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of Bunsen. Prominent examples are the Giant, the
Castle, Old Faithful, the Lone Star, and the Union.</p>

sketch and a similar one of the Castle Geyser cone and
two of the Yellowstone Falls are the <i>very first</i> ever made of these
objects. They were made in 1870 by Walter Trumbull, a member
of the Washburn Party, and by Private Charles Moore, one of
the escort under Lieutenant Doane. Moore was a man of excellent
education and considerable culture, and it was a matter of
comment among the members of the Expedition that he should
be content with the condition of a private soldier. His quaint
sketches of the Falls forcibly remind one of the original picture
of Niagara made by Father Hennepin in 1697.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting and singular fact pertaining to this
region is that in most cases the springs and geysers
have no underground connection with each other.
Water in contiguous pools stands at different levels,
and powerful geysers play with no apparent effect
upon others near by.</p>

<p>It is another interesting question to know whence
comes the water for these geysers and hot springs.
Into the hidden caverns of &ldquo;Old Faithful&rdquo; flow nearly
a million of gallons per hour. This is a large stream,
but it is a mere trifle compared with the entire outflow
of hot water throughout the Park. The subterranean
passages by which the necessary supply is furnished
to all these thousands of springs, certainly constitute
the most intricate and extensive system of water-works
of which there is any knowledge.</p>

<p>Not least wonderful of the features of the great
geysers are the marvelous formations which surround
them, more exquisitely beautiful than any production of
art. They are really much handsomer than those to
be found around the ordinary quiescent springs. The
falling or the dashing of the hot water seems to be in
some way essential to the finest results. To say that
these rocky projections simulate cauliflower, sponge,
fleeces of wool, flowers or bead-work, conveys but a
feeble hint of their marvelous beauty. It is indeed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
most interesting fact that nature here produces in
stone, by the almost mechanical process of deposition
from cooling water, the identical forms elsewhere produced
by the very different processes of animal and
vegetable life.</p>

</div>

<p>These formations are all silica and are of flinty
hardness. Bunsen, and Prof. Le Conte following him,
assert it to be a rule that the presence of silica in the
water is essential to the development of a geyser. In
one sense this is true, and in another it is not. Should
the heated waters find a ready-made tube, like a fissure
in solid rock, this would serve for a geyser tube as
well as any other. The Monarch Geyser, in Norris
Geyser Basin, seems to have originated in this way.
But in the general case, geyser tubes are built up, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
found ready made. In such cases silica is an indispensable
ingredient of the water. A calcareous deposit,
like that at Mammoth Hot Springs, would lack
strength to resist the violent strain of an eruption.
So it is found to be a fact that silica is the chief mineral
ingredient in the water of all important geysers.</p>

<p class="caption2">HOT SPRINGS.</p>


<p>Under this general head will be included all thermal
phenomena of the Park, except the geysers. The
term will cover the quiescent springs, the boiling
springs, the mud springs, or &ldquo;paint pots,&rdquo; and the
steam vents and fumaroles.</p>

<p>The quiescent spring seems to stand at the opposite
pole from the geyser. The conditions are such that
the water nowhere reaches a temperature sensibly
above the boiling point. The surface therefore steams
quietly away, unruffled except by the passing breeze.</p>

<p>The great attraction of these springs is in the inimitable
coloring of the water. It is not simply the
beautiful green or blue of great depths of clear water.
In no ordinary pool can one find all the colors of the
spectrum, flitting about, as though seen through a
revolving prism. Sometimes there is an iridescent effect
similar to that of a film of oil upon water; but
there is no oil here. There are doubtless many contributing
causes that produce these remarkable effects.
There is first a great depth of clear water which always
presents a beautiful appearance. Then there are the
mineral deposits on the sides of the crater, producing
indefinite reflection, the effects of which are multiplied
by the refractive power of the water. The mineral
ingredients dissolved or suspended in the water doubtless
add to the effect.</p>

<p>The hot springs on the Gardiner River are wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
different in character from those in any other part of
the Park. The water of these springs holds carbonate
of lime in solution while most of the others contain
silica. To this fact must be attributed the peculiar
character of the formations at Mammoth Hot
Springs. Wherever the deposits of springs are calcareous,
the character of the formations is the same,
and generally different from those produced by the
deposit of silica. They rise in terraces one above another,
and mold for themselves overhanging bowls of
transcendent beauty in form and color. In the tints
displayed by the water, however, these springs are not
unlike others in the Park.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Cleopatra Terrace.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The rims about the quiescent springs are often very
beautiful, and the observer is astonished to see how
they stand up above the general surface of the ground
so evenly built that the water has hardly a choice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
route in flowing away. Tyndall, however, makes this
puzzling phenomenon clear. He says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine the case of a simple thermal siliceous
spring, whose waters trickle down a gentle incline;
the water thus exposed evaporates speedily, and silica
is deposited. This deposit gradually elevates the side
over which the water passes, until finally the latter
has to take another course. The same takes place
here; the ground is elevated as before, and the spring
has to move forward. Thus it is compelled to travel
round and round, discharging its silica and deepening
the shaft in which it dwells, until finally, in the course
of ages, the simple spring has produced that wonderful
apparatus which has so long puzzled and astonished
both the traveler and the philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boiling spring is intermediate between the
quiescent spring and the geyser. The circulation is
sufficiently free to prevent a great rise of temperature
in the lower depths of the tube, and nothing more
than a surface ebullition, often extremely violent, results.
These springs are generally objects of secondary
interest. They are simply enormous caldrons;
any kettle placed over a brisk fire simulates their action
on a small scale.</p>

<p>The mud springs, or Paint Pots, as they are now always
called, are extremely curious phenomena. They
are caused by the rising of steam through considerable
depths of earthy material. The water is just sufficient
in quantity to keep the material in a plastic condition,
and the steam operates upon it precisely as it
does upon a kettle of thick mush. Generally there
are various mineral ingredients, mostly oxides of iron,
which impart different colors to different parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
group. As the steam puffs up here and there from
the thick mass, it forms the mud into a variety of imitative
figures, prominent among which is that of the
lily. These figures immediately sink back into the
general mass, only to be formed anew by other puffs
of steam. The material is so fine as to be almost impalpable
between the fingers. Lieutenant Doane, however,
justly observes that &ldquo;mortar might well be
good after being constantly worked for perhaps ten
thousand years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other phenomena very common throughout the
Park are steam vents or fumaroles in which there
is no water or only a very small quantity. They are
not ordinarily of much popular interest, although
there are a few remarkable examples. Among these
may be mentioned the Black Growler in the Norris
Geyser Basin, and Steamboat Spring on the east shore
of the Yellowstone Lake.</p>

<p>The hot spring areas of the Park are both numerous
and extensive. They abound throughout the valleys
of the Yellowstone, the Madison, and the Snake Rivers,
and the number of individual springs is several
thousand.</p>

<p class="caption2">FOSSIL FORESTS OF THE YELLOWSTONE.</p>


<p>A region of great popular and scientific interest in
the Yellowstone Park, although as yet hardly known
to the tourist, owing to the incomplete condition of
the road system, is that of the Fossil Forests in the
north-east corner of the Park. The facts which have
been brought to light concerning the origin of these
forests are worthy of particular consideration.</p>

<p>The trees are found to occur in different planes or
horizons of growth, one above another, until the
whole series represents a thickness of many hundreds,
and possibly thousands, of feet. Going back to the
first of these growths, it is found to have been destroyed
by an outpouring of volcanic material, which
partially or wholly submerged it. After the flow had
ceased, the ordinary atmospheric and aqueous agencies
began work, eroding the surface in some places
and depositing the products of erosion in others,
while vegetation rapidly covered the newly-formed
soil. A subsequent flow destroyed this second
growth and gave a new horizon, on which the same
process was repeated. This continued until there
were at least nine, and probably twelve, of these consecutive
growths.</p>

<p>The lava flows in this particular section do not
seem to have been characterized by great heat. They
were composed of volcanic agglomerate, in which
there was a large admixture of mud and water, with
sufficient heat to destroy life, but not to char or consume
its products. The percolation of siliceous waters
gradually turned the arboreal vegetation into stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
by the process of substitution, and thus preserved in
these silent monuments a record of the events which
once transpired there. When the last of the eruptions
had ceased, there existed in this locality a vast
depth of volcanic <i>ejectamenta</i>, composed of many
layers, on each of which was standing, buried in the
layer next above, the trunks of extinct forest growths.</p>

partly exposed, both ends being still imbedded in the
rock. Some hollow trees show interiors beautifully
lined with holocrystalline quartz.</p>

<p>How long it took each growth to reach maturity;
how long it flourished afterward before destruction;
and how long the several lava flows suspended vegetable
growth; are matters largely conjectural. But at
the very lowest estimate the time represented by these
various accumulations can not be less than five thousand
years.</p>

<p>That these early trees were of a different species
from those which now flourish there, need not excite
surprise, for climatic and other conditions are wholly
changed. But an equal difference seems also to have
prevailed between the successive growths, the trees of
which were not only unlike each other, but nearly all
were of species hitherto unknown to science. Fortunately
the rare perfection of some of the specimens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
particularly of the leaves and bark, have greatly simplified
their classification, and have given valuable
clues to their geologic age.</p>

<p>The products of these petrifactions in time strewed
the surface of the ground with such an abundance of
specimens as to give the locality its present name.
Most of the lighter specimens, and some of the heavier,
have been carried away.</p>

<p>Besides the general interest of these old forests to
the casual observer, they are of great value to science,
for probably in no other part of the globe can a similar
chapter of its history be found more clearly recorded.</p>

<p class="caption2">FAUNA OF THE YELLOWSTONE.</p>


<p>The universal curiosity of people to see what are
popularly called wild animals, especially those larger
species which never frequent the precincts of civilization,
is a fact of which it is not easy to give a
philosophical explanation. In this country the rapid
disappearance, amounting almost to annihilation, of
the large game is looked upon as a great misfortune;
and in later years there has arisen a fixed purpose
that protection shall be secured for the surviving remnants
of those species which once with the red man
held possession of the continent. The statutes of
nearly every state give evidence of the universality of
this sentiment.</p>

<p>As a means of accomplishing such a purpose, no
institution promises to be more effectual than the
Yellowstone Park. It ought, in this respect, to be a
complete realization of Catlin&rsquo;s dream. Its importance
as a game preserve was recognized in the Act of
Dedication, and has become more and more pronounced
as acquaintance with it has increased.</p>

<p>The Park is fortunately better adapted for this purpose
than any other tract of similar extent in America.
It offers very little to tempt the cupidity of man. Its
mineral wealth is buried so deeply under the lava that
no miner will ever reach it. Its altitude and climate
unfit it for agriculture. Its forests, though excellent
for shade, are of little value for lumber. But as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
home for the native species of the continent, it possesses
unrivaled advantages. These are admirably
summed up in the following paragraph from the pen
of Prof. Hague:</p>

</div>

<p>It is a matter of profound regret that the many years
of lax administration in the Park to a great degree
nullified its purposes as a game preserve. Killing of
wild animals was not absolutely prohibited until 1883,
and the restricted license previously in force was
shamefully abused. Some of the larger species were
greatly reduced in numbers, while in a few instances
they were practically exterminated. In later years,
the elk, antelope, deer, bear and beaver, have rapidly
regained their former numbers, and there is no reason
to apprehend their extinction. There are now no fewer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
than 30,000 elk in the Park. For the buffalo, mountain
sheep, and a few other varieties, the prospect is good,
though not so flattering. The number of buffalo does
not probably exceed two hundred, and the possibility
of their early extinction has led the Smithsonian Institution
to allot a sum of money for the construction
of a large inclosure in the Park, where at least a portion
of the herd can be kept and be thus more carefully
protected. Of the moose, mountain lion, wolverine,
lynx, wild cat, marten, and otter the perpetuation
is more doubtful. They were too much reduced in
numbers during the game slaughtering era. The
smaller species, such as porcupines, foxes, gophers,
squirrels, woodchucks, and the like, flourish in great
numbers.</p>

<p>The tourist often feels a keen disappointment in
passing through the Park in that he does not see more
game, and he not infrequently expresses positive doubts
of its existence. He should remember, however, that
it is the nature of wild game to shun the haunts of
man. If he will remain for some time in the Park
and will frequent those regions remote from the tourists
routes he will see game in plenty. In one important
instance he rarely goes away disappointed.
Bruin generally accommodates him. The fine instincts
of that intelligent brute have shown him that
it is much easier to get a living from the refuse
about the hotels than to forage for it in the wilds
of parsimonious nature. Nightfall, therefore, always
brings him about to the great delight of the game-seeking
tourist. The incidents of each season to
which these bears unwittingly give rise are among the
amusing features of tourist life in that region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The herbivorous game generally seek the seclusion
of the hills in summer, but the deep snows of winter
will not permit them to remain there. At that season
they descend to the valleys, of which the most important
are the Hayden, the Junction, and the Pelican
Valleys, and those about the headwaters of the Snake
River. The preservation of these tracts as a free
winter pasturage is absolutely essential to the perpetuity
of game in the Yellowstone Park.</p>

<p>Although an ornithologist, in passing through the
Park, would report a list of native birds so extensive
as to lead one to think that they abound in great
numbers, there is really a noticeable absence of the
winged tribes. There are birds, of course, but in
numbers, variety, and beauty not to be compared
with those in lower altitudes. The only varieties that
would attract attention from any but specialists are
the larger birds, which are often quite plentiful about
the lakes. There are great numbers of pelicans, gulls,
fish-hawks, and cranes, with now and then a wild
swan. Eagles are not uncommon, while hawks, woodpeckers,
and robins are frequently seen. The sharp-tailed
or willow grouse is common, and in the fall of
the year astonishing numbers of wild geese and ducks
frequent the marshes. There are many other varieties,
conspicuous mainly for their paucity of numbers.</p>

<p>Piscatorially speaking, the Yellowstone National
Park has no rival as a paradise for the angler. The
generous gift of nature and the admirable work of
the United States Fish Commission, supplemented by
the wise protection of the government, leave nothing to
be desired by even the most devout follower of Isaak
Walton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Not all the streams of the Park were originally
stocked with fish. Where the waters leave the great
volcanic plateau and fall to the underlying formations,
the cataracts form impassable barriers to the
ascent of fish. In the lower courses of all the
streams there were native trout, but above the falls,
with one exception, there were none. The exception
of the Yellowstone River and Lake is a most interesting
one. Why the Falls of the Yellowstone, the
highest and most impassable of all, should apparently
have proven no barrier, is at first a puzzling question.
But the solution is to be found in Two-Ocean Pass.
Across this remarkable divide fish may easily make
their way, and the Yellowstone Lake is unquestionably
stocked from this direction. We thus have an
example, probably without parallel, of an extensive
body of water on the Atlantic slope stocked by nature
with fish from the Pacific.</p>

<p>The trout of the Yellowstone Lake are to some extent
infected with a disease which renders them unfit
for eating. In earlier times particularly, this condition
was generally prevalent. But more recently the
disease seems to be disappearing, and in time it will
probably die out altogether.</p>

<p>In 1889 and 1890, the United States Fish Commission
undertook to stock all the fishless streams in the
Park, and planted about 83,000 yearling trout in the
various streams and lakes. The varieties were Brook,
Lake, Loch Leven, and Von Behr trout. Recent examination
of these plants shows that all have taken
decisive root, and that within a few years there will
not be a hidden stream or lake in the Park which will
be without its attractions for the sportsman.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_II_CHAPTER_VII" id="PT_II_CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="caption2">FLORA OF THE YELLOWSTONE.</p>


<p>The most conspicuous feature of the Park flora is
the wide extent of forest growth which covers some
eighty-four per cent of its area. This is the more noticeable
because the surrounding country below the
mountains is practically treeless. The Park forests
consist almost exclusively of pine and fir. The trees
are generally tall and slender and of little use for
lumber. They are usually unattractive in appearance,
although in some places among the mountains the
spruce and fir attain a size, form and hue of foliage
that are exceedingly beautiful.</p>

<p>Among the several species may be noted the following:</p>

<p>Black pine (<i>Pinus Murrayana</i>) so called from the
dark hue of its foliage when seen in dense bodies.</p>

<p>Red fir (<i>Pseudotsuga Douglasii</i>) the largest variety
in the Park, sometimes attaining a diameter of five
feet.</p>

<p>Balsam (<i>Abies subalpina</i>). It flourishes near the
snow fields and is the beauty of the forest.</p>

<p>Spruce (<i>Pinus Engelmanni</i>). Like the preceding it
flourishes at high altitudes. It is tall and slender,
and is good for lumber.</p>

<p>Red cedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) is found to a limited
extent.</p>

<p>Poplar or aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) flourishes
among the sheltered foot-hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Dwarf maple is occasionally found.</p>

<p>Willow thickets abound in great abundance.</p>

<p>Of these varieties the first is found more abundantly
than all the others combined. In many places it has
fallen down and strews the country to such an extent
as to be absolutely impassable on horseback. There is
very little timber of marketable value, and at first
thought it would seem that nature has here lavished
her energies in a most wasteful manner.</p>

<p>But the great value of these forest growths, is their
agency in the conservation of a water supply for the
surrounding country. A glance at the map will show
that the Park is in the midst of a vast arid region extending
far into the surrounding states. The reclamation
of these desert wastes, and their conversion
into productive lands, can be accomplished by irrigation
alone, and for this purpose the abundant streams
which descend from the mountains are the indispensable
water supply.</p>

<p>From the summit of the Grand Teton, the range of
vision covers probably the most remarkable group of
river sources upon the earth. To the north rises the
Missouri which flows three thousand miles through
Montana, the Dakotas, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and
Missouri. To the east rises the Yellowstone, which,
after leaving the Park, flows four hundred miles
through southern and eastern Montana until it unites
with the Missouri. From the eastern foot-hills of
the Absaroka and Shoshone Ranges flow the Wind
and Big Horn Rivers through the extensive valleys of
the same names in Wyoming and Montana. Southwardly,
across the Wind River Range rises the Platte
which flows eastward eight hundred miles through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Wyoming and Nebraska. From the west flank of
these mountains issue the tributaries of the Green
River (afterward the Colorado) which flows through
Wyoming, Utah and Arizona into the Gulf of California.
Finally, interlaced with the sources of the
Yellowstone, and the Missouri, are those of the Snake
River which flows through Wyoming, Idaho and Washington
into the Columbia, and thus reaches the Pacific.</p>

<p>Not only do these streams rise in this limited area;
they derive from it most of their waters. In the arid
lowlands they receive but slight accessions, and often
actually shrink under evaporation. It is therefore
from a relatively small tract of country that the
future water supply must come for portions of ten
states in the great arid belt of the west.</p>

<p>The conditions which nature has established around
this remarkable fountain-head are admirably adapted
for the creation and maintenance of an unlimited water
supply. Over an area of more than 5,000 square
miles there prevails an average altitude of perhaps
7,500 feet; sufficient to insure enormous annual snowfalls,
but not so great as to prevent their complete
melting in summer. But, that they may not melt too
rapidly, the whole region is covered with a thick forest
growth cutting off the intense rays of the summer
sun, and covering the ground with a vegetable mold
through which the surface waters filter but slowly.
It is a conservative estimate, based upon observations
in connection with road work in the Park, that these
forests prolong the melting of the snows from four to
six weeks. This condition greatly lessens the liability
to sudden floods, and maintains a generous supply of
water far into the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been estimated<a name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a> that from the Park alone, at
low water, there flows per second 4,000 cubic feet of
water. If the time ever comes when this supply is
so far used as to threaten exhaustion, there will be
found in the basin of Yellowstone Lake the most
perfect facilities in the world for the construction of
an artificial reservoir of almost limitless capacity at a
comparatively insignificant cost. A dam could be
thrown across the gorge at the first rapids in the
Yellowstone below the Lake, and without injuring
the natural condition of that region, could easily be
made to quadruple the present capacity of the Lake.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AW_49" id="Footnote_AW_49"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AW_49"><span class="label">[AW]</span></a> By Dr.
William Hallock, United States Geological Survey.</p></div>

<p>The Park with its contiguous area thus presents
magnificent possibilities in the development of the
surrounding country&mdash;possibilities of which its founders
little dreamed, but which they unconsciously foreshadowed
when they declared that this region should
be forever set apart for the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; as well as for
the &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; of the people.</p>

<p>Besides its wealth of trees, the Park produces other
interesting flora. Interspersed among the forests and
ornamenting the open glades are flowers and shrubs
in endless profusion. We quote from the description
of one of the early visitors:</p>

<p>"The choke-cherry, the goose-berry, the buffalo-berry,
and black and red currants, are found along
the streams and in moist places of the middle and
lower altitudes. The meadows and hill-sides are
spangled with bright-colored flowers, among which
may be noted the bee-larkspur, the columbine, the
harebell, the lupine, the evening primrose, the aster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the painted cup, the gentian, and various kinds of
euphorbia. It is not uncommon to find daises, buttercups,
forget-me-nots, white-ground phlox, and other
field flowers flourishing in profusion near the melting
snow banks during the month of August. Scarcely
a night throughout the year passes without frost, even
though the temperature by day is over 80 F., so that all
forms of vegetation in the Park grow and bloom under
somewhat unusual conditions. Indeed, when ice
forms in the water-pails of camping parties during
the night, as often happens, and the petals of the
flowers become crisp with frost; even then the blooms
are not harmed, but thaw out bright and fresh when
the hot sun touches them."</p>

<p>The flowers form a most attractive feature of the
Park, and give an interesting study of the way in
which altitude and temperature affect well known
varieties. It is only after a second look that one can
trace in the mountain dandelion, huckleberry, and
other species a resemblance to those of lower altitudes.
The extreme shortness of the season causes vegetation
to mature quickly, and before the flush of spring
has disappeared from the leaves the palor of autumn
makes its appearance.</p>

<p>The mountain grasses are generally abundant in
the open country and even in many places among the
forests. The writer just quoted says:</p>

<p>"The pasturage on the many open spaces is excellent,
the mountain meadows being covered with a mat of
nutritious grasses. The predominating variety is the
bunch grass, upon which the horses of tourists generally
subsist, keeping in good condition without the
need of oats. Among other kinds, are the blue joint,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
fescue, and beard grasses, as well as Alpine timothy,
all of which grow luxuriantly."</p>

<p>The early autumns tinge the foliage of the willow
parks and other groups of shrubbery with a wealth
of color not often seen elsewhere. Even the frost on
the grass upon sharp mornings seems to have a peculiar
beauty, and one may trace terrestrial rainbows in
all the perfection of those set in the sky.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_II_CHAPTER_VIII" id="PT_II_CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="caption2">THE PARK IN WINTER.</p>


<p>From the end of September to the end of May the
Park is closed to the tourist; that is, the hotels do not
receive guests, and camping is too precarious to be attempted.
It is generally possible, however, to get
into the Park as late as the middle or end of November,
very rarely as late as Christmas. In May, the
snowfalls are light, but the accumulations of the previous
winter render traveling out of the question.
With great difficulty the hotel company reaches its
nearest hotels as early as May 16. Some of the roads
remain impassable fully a month later.</p>

<p>What the fall of snow is in the upper Park has
never been determined; but at Mammoth Hot Springs,
altitude 6,200 feet, an average for six years, from
November to April inclusive, is ten feet per year,
with a maximum of fifteen feet and a minimum of
five. But on the Park Plateau, 1,000 to 1,500 feet
higher, the fall is certainly much greater. No doubt
its light depth aggregates twenty feet. The weight
of this snow often destroys the railing of bridges and
injures the buildings of the Park.</p>

<p>The drifts accumulate in phenomenal magnitude.
No matter how deep a ravine may be, the wind will
pile the snow up in it until it is level with the surrounding
country. Some of these drifts on the
mountain sides are hundreds of feet deep and never
entirely melt away. Even on the general plateau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
they last until the middle of July. The Cañon
Hotel is almost buried every winter. The snow
actually reaches the second story windows, and the
drift behind the hotel would last throughout the
summer were its melting not facilitated by cutting it
in pieces with shovels. It verily seems that all the
conditions of climate here conspire to make this region
one of the snowiest in the world.</p>

<p>Of course, general access to the Park under such
conditions is wholly out of the question. Only on
snow-shoes is it possible at all. The hotel company
has a watchman at each of its buildings, who drags
out a lonely existence through the two hundred days
from November to May. He can talk over the telephone
line with Mammoth Hot Springs, and at long
intervals he receives a call, and perhaps mail, from
&ldquo;Telephone Pete,&rdquo; who travels the line to keep it in
order. In some places, also, small squads of soldiers
are stationed for the winter.</p>

<p>The art of traveling by snow-shoe is a thoroughly
interesting one, notwithstanding the fact that it is
about the most difficult method of travel known and
is rarely resorted to except from sheer necessity.</p>

<p>The instrument used in the Park for this purpose is
called a <i>ski</i> (pronounced skee). It is a long slender
strip of wood&mdash;ash, Norway pine, or hickory&mdash;some
twelve feet long, four or five inches wide, and just
thick enough to give needed strength. About midway
of its length is a strap through which the toe is
slipped and by which the foot pulls the <i>ski</i> along.
The bearing surface of the two <i>skis</i> is about eight
square feet, and holds the weight of the body even in
soft snow without sinking more than a few inches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
The bottom surface is polished smooth and then
rubbed with a mixture of tallow and beeswax to
make it free from friction. A pole is an important
accompaniment, aiding to slide the traveler along and
steady him on the <i>skis</i>. It also serves as a brake in
descending steep hills, the traveler sitting astride it
and bearing the rear end into the snow.</p>

<p>Down hill work is indeed glorious. No express
train can rival the <i>ski</i> for speed. Its only drawback is
danger of accident. On level country <i>ski</i> traveling is
simply walking on a board walk, except that the pedestrian
carries the board with him, and makes and
unmakes the road as fast as he goes. This is hard
enough, especially if the snow is sticky, but when
it comes to up hill traveling it is a truly laborious
matter. If the hill is steep, there is danger of losing
one&rsquo;s grip on the snow and sliding backward down
the hill. Where the ascent is too steep to work up by
direct forward movement, &ldquo;corduroying&rdquo; is resorted
to. The traveler works up sidewise, stepping up a
foot or so with the upper <i>ski</i> and following with the
lower. Generally this sidewise movement is combined
with a slight forward movement, the <i>skis</i> being pointed
up hill at as steep an inclination as they will hold.</p>

<p>The dress and equipment of the snow-shoe traveler
are reduced to a minimum consistent with protection
from the climate. This protection is really needed
only at camping places, for the extraordinary exertion
of traveling keeps the body in a continuous glow of
warmth. Generally, warm woolen underwear, with canvas
surface garments to keep out the wind and to
shed snow, are the essential features of the dress. No
overcoat is worn, but a tightly drawn belt takes its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
place. The feet are the weak point. &ldquo;Natural wool
socks, then a pair of Indian moccasins, then a pair
of heavy gray army socks, then Arctic overshoes and
leggings,&rdquo; is the description of an equipment actually
used. A broad hat is frequently worn to keep snow
out of the neck, and colored glasses are indispensable
to prevent snow blindness.</p>

<p>Baggage is limited to the strictest necessities, and is
so packed that it will rest uniformly on the back from
the shoulders to the hips.</p>

<p>No eating of snow or drinking of water can be
safely indulged in while <i>en route</i>. The traveler must
go strictly &ldquo;dry&rdquo; between meals.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course traveling of this sort is attended with
much peril. A man must rely wholly on himself. No
wagon or saddle is available if he is injured or sick.
Heavy storms may blind him and cause him to lose
his way. In short, a snow-shoe trip through the Park
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
is an undertaking which requires a vigorous physique,
a determined will, and a good fund of courage. Very
few, except those whose duty has required it, have
ever made the attempt. But it is the unanimous verdict
of those who have, that, glorious as the Park is
in summer, it is even more glorious in winter. One
can readily understand this to be so. Evergreen forests
never appear to better advantage than when laden
with snow. Ice formations always enhance the beauty
of water-falls.<a name="FNanchor_AX_50" id="FNanchor_AX_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AX_50" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> The rolling open valleys of the Park
must be doubly beautiful when robed in drifted snow.
It is a pity that this silvery landscape should forever
remain excluded from the general view.</p>

<p class="caption2">THE PARK AS A HEALTH RESORT.</p>


<p>The climate of the Yellowstone National Park, to
any one with a fair reserve of health, is of the most
beneficial kind. The general public will be interested
in the subject only as it relates to that season when it
is possible to visit the Park.</p>

<p>For the six months beginning with May, the average
temperature will not vary much from the following
figures, Fahrenheit:</p>

<table summary="avg temps">

<p>These temperatures are for Mammoth Hot Springs.
For the Park Plateau they should be diminished by
not less than ten degrees. No month of the year in
that region passes without ice-forming frosts. It will
be seen that during June, July, August, and September,
the thermometer makes excursions to the neighborhood
of the nineties. This, however, is only in
the middle of the day, and is due to the direct intensity
of the sun&rsquo;s rays. No such heat pervades the
general atmosphere. As soon as the sun is near setting,
the temperature falls rapidly. The night temperature
rarely gets above 55&#176; or 60&#176;, and averages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
scarcely half as much. The Park is noted for its delightful
sleep-giving qualities, which constitute no
small part of its claim as a health resort.</p>

<p>Summer in the Park is comparatively short. It
may not be strictly true that &ldquo;the Park has only three
seasons, July, August, and Winter,&rdquo; but it is true
that July and August are the only two months free
from the ordinary characteristics of winter. Snows
are frequent in June and September, while May and
October are well on the snowy side of the year. July
and August are the Park summer. The weather is
settled. The air is pure and bracing and not too
cold. The long imprisoned vegetation bursts suddenly
into full life and beauty, and in a short period
take place all the changes which require months in
lower altitudes.</p>

<p>That there is life and health in that summer atmosphere,
no one who has breathed it will deny. At the
same time, as has already been hinted, it is healthful
only for those who have some foundation to build
upon. Persons suffering from any form of heart
disease or advanced pulmonary trouble, or those
greatly reduced in strength from any cause, would
better stay away. The altitude and sharp air might
prove too severe.</p>

<p>A matter which has naturally attracted considerable
inquiry is the therapeutic value of the mineral springs
of the Park. The superstitious faith in the efficacy
of mineral waters to restore health, which has characterized
mankind in all ages, caused the physically
afflicted to hail the discovery of that region as the
promised fountain of new life. The first explorers to
ascend the Gardiner in 1871 found &ldquo;numbers of invalids&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
encamped on its banks, where the hot waters
from Mammoth Hot Springs enter the stream; and it
is recorded that &ldquo;they were most emphatic in their
favorable expressions in regard to their sanitary
effects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this impression was very evanescent. No one
now goes to the Park because of its mineral waters.
Nevertheless, it would be wholly premature to assume
that there is no medicinal virtue in them. Certainly
there is in the Park almost every variety of mineral
spring; there are abundant and luxurious waters for
bathing; and it is not at all improbable that the opportunities
afforded in this region may yet be utilized
to the great advantage of the public.</p>

<p>But for health-giving qualities, the Park will never
be dependent on its mineral waters. Its true value
lies in other and more potent influences. The pure
water of its snow-fed streams, the exhilarating atmosphere,
the bracing effect of altitude, the wholesome
fatigue of daily rambles over the rough, mountainous
country, the fragrant odor of the pine boughs which
every-where pervades the atmosphere, and, above all,
the beautiful and varied scenery, which exalts the
mind and diverts the attention from cares that are
too often the real cause of physical ills&mdash;these are the
true virtues of the Yellowstone Park as a health
resort.</p>

<p class="caption2">ROADS, HOTELS, TRANSPORTATION.</p>


<p>The Park, as is well known, is a very extensive
tract of country, and its various points of interest are
widely separated from each other. The question of
ways and means for getting comfortably through it is
an all-important one. If the roads are bad, the hotels
ill-kept, or the transportation uncomfortable, no
amount of grandeur of natural scenery can compensate
for these defects. In making a tour of the Park,
the visitor travels not less than 150 miles, sometimes
considerably more, and remains in the Park about
one week. He is thus quite at the mercy of those
who have the management and control of those matters
which form the subject of this chapter.</p>

<p>The road system of the Park, when completed, will
comprise a belt line, connecting the principal centers
of interest; approaches, by which access may be had to
the Park from different directions; side roads, leading
from the main route to isolated points of interest;
and trails, by which pack outfits can reach desired
points to which regular roads will never be built.</p>

<p>The belt line includes Mammoth Hot Springs,
Norris Geyser Basin, Lower Geyser Basin, Upper
Geyser Basin, the Yellowstone Lake, the Grand
Cañon, and Junction Valley. A cross-road passes
from Norris to the Grand Cañon.</p>

<p>The approaches are not all yet selected, but in time
there will be at least one on each side of the Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Trails are important adjuncts of the Park road system.
They were long ago selected and opened up,
and they are of great importance in patroling the
Park. They are also much used by those tourists
who remain for a considerable time.</p>

<p>The mileage of the completed road system will be
about as follows:</p>

<table summary="milage">

  <td>Belt line</td>

</table>

<p>In regard to construction, it is hardly necessary to
say that nothing but the best macadamized roads
should be built. The inherent difficulties of the work
are great. The soil in many places is of the most
wretched character. The country is exceedingly
rough. The streams are almost without number.
The snow lies on some of the roads until the middle
of June. The mud in the wet season is bad, and the
dust of the dry season is worse. The soft volcanic
rocks, which so generally prevail, make poor road
metal. But all these difficulties can be overcome, if
Congress will but provide for a systematic completion
of the project. At present, the annual allowance is
too small to promise any thing like good work, and it
will be many years before the hopes of the government
engineers in the matter will be realized.</p>

<p>The work itself is as attractive as ever falls to the
lot of the road engineer, and it is doubtful if another
opportunity exists to develop a road system which, if
properly done, will reflect so much credit upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
government building it. It is used by visitors from
all lands. It passes through every variety of scenery.
It presents every known problem of road engineering.
In short, it combines all the elements to make it,
when complete, one of the noted highways of the
world.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not impossible that the tourist may yet be carried
by boat from the west shore of the Lake to near
the head of the Falls, nor that a bridge worthy of its
surroundings&mdash;an arch of the native rock so studied
as to simulate a natural bridge&mdash;will span the river
near the Upper Falls and give access to the many
splendid views from the right bank of the Grand
Cañon.</p>

<p>The tourist transportation of the Park is done
mostly by coach, ordinarily with four horses each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Surreys and saddle horses are also provided when desired.
The present system is the result of long development,
and is very satisfactory. With proper
roads, it would be all that could be desired.</p>

<p>Electric transportation in the Park has often been
suggested, but there are certain grave objections, to
be discussed in a later chapter, which will probably
always prevent its introduction.</p>

</div>

<p>When the hotel system of the Park is complete,
there will be no fewer than seven good houses and
three lunch stations along the belt line and approaches.
The hotels will be at Mammoth Hot Springs, Norris
Geyser Basin, Lower Geyser Basin, Upper Geyser
Basin, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Cañon, and Junction
Valley. The present management of the hotels has
developed into a very efficient system. It is conducted
by a single company whose business headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
is at Mammoth Hot Springs, from which
point all supplies are shipped. A telegraph line connects
it with points in the interior and with the outside
world. The manager of each hotel knows in
advance the number of guests he must provide for,
and the convenience of the tourist is thus carefully
arranged beforehand. With a reasonable extension
and development of the present system, the Park will
be admirably equipped in this respect.</p>

<p>Besides the regular tourists&mdash;those who make the
usual trip, stopping at the hotels&mdash;there are hundreds
who pass through the Park with camping outfits.
During the months of July and August and early
September, this is by no means an undesirable method.
It is less comfortable, to be sure, than the ordinary
method, but at the same time it is less expensive and
more independent. In the latter part of August, the
Park fairly swarms with these camping parties. They
give the authorities plenty to do, for the danger of
forest conflagrations from their camp fires is very
great.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_II_CHAPTER_XI" id="PT_II_CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="caption2">ADMINISTRATION OF THE PARK.</p>


<p>The administration of the Park is assigned by law
to the Secretary of the Interior, who delegates his authority
to a local Superintendent. By statute, also,
the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to call
upon the Secretary of War for such details of troops
as may be necessary to protect the Park. Owing to
the failure of Congress to provide for a civilian Superintendent
and police force, since 1886, the Secretary
of the Interior has found it necessary to avail
himself of this second statute, so that the present
working of the Park administration is on this wise:</p>

<p>An army officer, commanding the troops of the
Park, is the representative of the Secretary of the Interior,
and is called the Acting Superintendent of the
Park, on the assumption that the old <i>régime</i> of civilian
Superintendents is only temporarily suspended.
The Superintendent is charged with the enforcement
of the rules and regulations provided for the government
of the Park. As to all such matters, he receives
his instructions direct from the Secretary of the Interior,
and he annually submits to that official a report
upon the condition of the Park. For a police force,
he has two troops of cavalry, which he stations
throughout the Park as necessity requires. He has
also one civilian scout, paid for from the appropriation
for the army, whose duty it is to patrol the 5,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
square miles, more or less, in the original reservation
and the forest reserve!<a name="FNanchor_AY_51" id="FNanchor_AY_51"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_AY_51" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AY_51" id="Footnote_AY_51"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_AY_51"><span class="label">[AY]</span></a> A portion
of the latest appropriation for the Park is authorized
to be expended in the employment of additional scouts.
This policy ought to be continued.</p></div>

<p>The specific duties which form the burden of the
Superintendent&rsquo;s work are:</p>

<p>1. To see that all leases and privileges granted by
the Secretary of the Interior to private parties are
strictly observed, and that all business conducted in
the Park is in pursuance of government authority
and in accordance with specific conditions and limitations.</p>

<p>2. The protection of the Park from vandalism.
This is a very important matter. The pardonable desire
to carry off specimens from the beautiful formations,
and the unpardonable craze to cover them with
individual names, would, if unrestrained, soon quite
destroy what nature, through long ages, has so laboriously
produced.</p>

<p>3. The protection of game. All around the Park
are hordes of law-breakers, who let pass no opportunity
to destroy the surviving species. To avert this
calamity requires the utmost vigilance of the Park
police.</p>

<p>4. The preservation of forests. This has always
been the most onerous and trying duty of Park
officials. The importance of the forests is so far-reaching
that their destruction would be a public
calamity. No exertion can be considered too great
which may prevent it.</p>

<p>5. The construction of roads and bridges in the
Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Other functions which the Superintendent fills are
the social duties of his position, which at certain seasons
exact much of his attention. Official visitors depend
upon him entirely for pilotage through the Park.
Private parties bring letters soliciting favors, and on
the whole he finds his time well occupied with these
pleasant, though sometimes onerous, duties.</p>

<p>The office building of the Superintendent, who is
also commanding officer of Fort Yellowstone, is at
Mammoth Hot Springs. A pretty little garrison is
built upon the white formation opposite the hotel, and
in winter, the whole military force, except small detachments
in various places, is gathered at that point.</p>

<p>At Mammoth Hot Springs are also located the post-office
and jail, and at this point the judicial officers
of the Park hold court to try offenses against the
Park statutes and regulations.</p>

<p class="caption2">A TOUR OF THE PARK.<br />
<i>Preliminary.</i></p>


<p>In the following description there will be mentioned
in succinct outline all the notable features of
interest in the Yellowstone National Park. For more
detailed information, the reader is referred to the list
of names in "<a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>."</p>

<p>The necessary limit of space forbids any thing like
extended description, even if the inherent difficulties
of such a task would permit. Captain Ludlow has
well stated the nature of these difficulties:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Park scenery, as a whole,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is too
grand, its scope too immense, its details too varied
and minute, to admit of adequate description, save by
some great writer, who, with mind and pen equally
trained, can seize upon the salient points, and, with
just discrimination, throw into proper relief the varied
features of mingled grandeur, wonder, and beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the many who have attempted, with pen or pencil,
to reproduce the wonders of the Yellowstone, no
one has yet completely satisfied these important requirements.
The writer, for his part, will modestly
decline any such undertaking, and, like that pioneer
explorer, Folsom, will confine his descriptions &ldquo;to
the bare facts.&rdquo; He will, however, occasionally call to
aid those who have seen and written of these wonders.
To the early explorers, in particular, who entered
this region before it became generally known,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
its strange phenomena appealed with an imaginative
force which the guide-book tourist of to-day can
hardly realize. This may account for the fact that
some of these explorers, who have never, before or
since, put pen to paper with any literary purpose in
view, have left in their narratives strokes of word
painting which the most gifted writer would find it
difficult to excel.</p>

<p>The season selected for the tour will be the early
days of July. The rain and snow and chilly air, not
uncommon in June, are gone. The drought and
smoke of August and September are still remote.
Even mosquitoes, so amazingly plentiful at certain
seasons (Langford found them on the very summit of
the Grand Teton), have not yet made their appearance.
It is late enough, however, to call forth in their
richest glory the magnificent profusion of flowers
which every-where abound in the Park. The air is at
its best, full of life and energy, and so clear that it confounds
distances and gives to objects, though far away,
a distinctness quite unknown in lower altitudes. The
skies, as they appear at this season, surpass the sunny
skies of Italy, and the tourist will find in their empyreal
depths a beauty and fascination forever lacking
in the dingy air of civilization. In short, the
open air stage trips through that rich mountain atmosphere
will form one of the most attractive and
invigorating features of the tour.</p>

<p>Without further preliminary, the rôle of guide will
now be assumed, and the tourist will be conducted
through the wonders of this celebrated country, following,
over most of the distance, the present general
route.</p>

</div>

<p>Distance five miles. The road for most of the way
lies in the valley of the Gardiner. The principal
points of interest en route are:</p>

<p><i>The Junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner Rivers</i>
which determines the north boundary of the Park. It
lies in the State of Montana, the state line being two
miles further south. The old prospector&rsquo;s route bore
off at this point and kept up the valley of the Yellowstone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Folsom took this route in 1869; so did the
Wasburn party in 1870. Hayden and Barlow in 1871
kept along the Gardiner and thus saw the Mammoth
Hot Springs.</p>

<p><i>The Gardiner Cañon</i> is a precipitous valley of loose
gray walls suggestive of danger from falling rocks.
The nests of fish-hawks here and there crown detached
pinnacles. The most striking feature of the
cañon is the river, a typical mountain torrent of such
rapid fall over its rocky bed that it is a continuous
succession of foaming cascades.</p>

<p>Some four miles up the river, at the point where the
road leaves it, the tourist gets his first sight of any
indication of subterranean heat. This is a large
stream of hot water, in early times called the <i>Boiling
River</i>, issuing from an opening in the rocks and
emptying directly into the river. It is formed of the
collected waters of Mammoth Hot Springs which find
their way to this point through underground passages.
It was here that &ldquo;numbers of invalids&rdquo; were encamped
when Hayden and Barlow saw the spot in
1871.</p>

<p>From the last crossing of the Gardiner a winding
road, which rises 600 feet in its length of one mile,
brings the tourist to the world-renowned <i>Mammoth
Hot Springs</i>, and to the administrative and business
headquarters of the Park.</p>

<p>First in importance, among the many points of interest
accessible from this locality, are the <i>Hot Springs
Terraces</i>. These have been built one upon another
until the present active portion constitutes a hill rising
300 feet above the site of the Mammoth Hot Springs
Hotel. The formation about these springs, it will be
remembered, is calcareous, and to this fact is due its
distinctive character, so different from the silica formations
which prevail nearly every-where else in the
Park. The overhanging bowls which these deposits
build up are among the finest specimens of Nature&rsquo;s
work in the world, while the water which fills them
is of that peculiar beauty to be found only in thermal
springs. Speaking of this feature Dr. Hayden says:</p>

<p>"The wonderful transparency of the water surpasses
any thing of the kind I have ever seen in any
other portion of the world. The sky, with the
smallest cloud that flits across it, is reflected in its
clear depths, and the ultramarine colors, more vivid
than the sea, are greatly heightened by constant,
gentle vibrations. One can look down into the clear
depths and see, with perfect distinctness, the minutest

exquisite beauty of the coloring and the variety of
forms baffle any attempt to portray them either with

<p><i>Cleopatra Spring</i>, <i>Jupiter Terrace</i>, <i>Pulpit Terrace</i>,
<i>Minerva Terrace</i>, the <i>Narrow Gauge Terrace</i>&mdash;an incongruous
name for a long fissure spring&mdash;the <i>White
Elephant</i>, another fissure spring, and the <i>Orange
Geyser</i>, a very pretty formation, dome-shaped, with a
pulsating spring in the top, are among the most interesting
of the active springs.</p>

<p><i>Liberty Cap</i> is the cone of an extinct spring and
stands forty-five feet high and twenty feet through
at the base.</p>

<p><i>Bath Lake</i> is a warm pool of considerable size,
much used in bathing.</p>

<p>Scattered over the formation in every direction are
caves, springs, steam-vents, handsome deposits, and
curiosities without number to attract and detain the
visitor. Many of them, like <i>Cupid&rsquo;s Cave</i>, the <i>Devil&rsquo;s
Kitchen</i>, and <i>McCartney&rsquo;s Cave</i>, are of much interest.
In the last-mentioned cave, or, more properly, crater,
an elk fell one winter when the crater was level full
with light snow. His antlers caught between the
sides of the crater, holding him in a suspended position
until he perished. He was found the following
spring by Mr. McCartney.</p>

<p>Besides the hot springs features, there are other
important objects of interest in this neighborhood.</p>

<p><i>Lookout Hill</i> is a prominent rounded elevation opposite
the hotel. Upon its summit is a block-house,
built by Colonel Norris, in 1879, as a headquarters
building for the Superintendent. The awkward and
inconvenient location was selected for its defensible
qualities. It will be remembered that the two previous
years, 1877 and 1878, had witnessed the Nez
Percé and Bannock incursions into the Park.</p>

<p><i>The Falls and Cañon of the Middle Gardiner</i>, distant
four miles from the hotel, are the finest scenery of the
kind in the Park, excepting only the Grand Cañon
of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p><i>Bunsen Peak</i> is a conspicuous summit located between
the Middle and West Forks of the Gardiner.
Its western face terminates in <i>Cathedral Rock</i>, a bold
cliff that overhangs the valley of <i>Glen Creek</i>.</p>

<p><i>Golden Gate</i> and <i>Kingman Pass</i> are names applied
to the picturesque cañon of Glen Creek. It is justly
considered one of the gems of the Park scenery. The
skillful engineering feat of carrying the tourist route
through this difficult cañon was performed by Lieutenant
D. C. Kingman, of the Corps of Engineers,
U. S. A., in 1884-5. <i>Rustic Falls</i> is a handsome cataract
near the head of the pass. The best view in this
vicinity is to be had from above the pass, looking
through it toward Mt. Everts.</p>

<p>Besides Bunsen Peak, the tourist will find <i>Terrace
Mountain</i>, <i>Sepulcher Mountain</i>, and <i>Electric Peak</i> ever
ready to satisfy whatever ambition for mountain
climbing he may possess.</p>

<p>The <i>East Gardiner Cañon</i> affords some fine views,
and the falls and rapids at its head are extremely
beautiful. It is through this cañon that access can
most easily be had to the summit of <i>Mt. Everts</i>. This
last name is given to a feature which bears almost no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
resemblance to the ordinary conception of a mountain.
It is simply a broad table-land extending from
the Yellowstone south and terminating in the lofty
and conspicuous bluff just across the Gardiner from
Mammoth Hot Springs. The mountain derives its
chief popular interest from the Everts episode, which
is described in the Appendix under &ldquo;Mt. Everts.&rdquo; It
is also of great interest to scientific inquirers. The
view from the prominent point opposite the forks of
the Gardiner is very fine. The whole Mammoth Hot
Springs formation and the group of buildings near
it; the cañons and falls of the three Gardiners; and
the array of mountain peaks across the valley, form a
rare and attractive landscape.</p>

<p>Mt. Everts and the surrounding country are the
home of the Park antelope and mountain sheep.</p>

<p>As explained elsewhere, Mammoth Hot Springs is
the official and business headquarters of the Park.
The handsome garrison of Fort Yellowstone is built
on the white formation, and with the hotel and transportation
buildings, the post-office, and various other
structures, gives the place a village appearance not to
be seen in any other part of the Park.</p>

<i>Mammoth Hot Springs to Norris Geyser Basin.</i></p>


<p>Distance, twenty miles. The first object of interest,
after ascending the long hill above the Springs (four
miles), is the <i>Gallatin Range</i> of mountains, which
bursts into full view upon emerging from Kingman
Pass. Its various peaks&mdash;<i>Joseph</i>, <i>Gray</i>, <i>Bannock</i>,
<i>Quadrant</i>, <i>the Dome</i>, <i>Mt. Holmes</i>, and others&mdash;still retain
the heavy snow drifts of the previous winter.
Some of these peaks remain in sight for thirty miles
along the tourist route.</p>

<p><i>Swan Lake</i> (4.5 miles) is a little pond on the right
of the road.</p>

<p><i>Willow Park</i> (8 miles) comprises the valley of the
lower course of Obsidian Creek. It is a dense growth
of willows, and forms an attractive sight, either in
the fresh foliage of spring or in its autumnal coloring.</p>

<p><i>Apollinaris Spring</i> (10 miles) is on the left of the
roadway, in a pine forest. Tourists generally stop
and try its water.</p>

<p><i>Obsidian Cliff</i> (12 miles) is composed of a kind of
volcanic glass, black as anthracite, which abounds at
this point in enormous masses. The Indians once
quarried implements of war and the chase here, and
many fine arrowheads have been picked up by explorers.
The building of the first road along the
base of this cliff has some historic celebrity, owing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the novel method employed. It was done by Colonel
Norris, who thus describes it:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 487px;">

<div class="fig_text_lf"><i>Terry Engr. Co.</i></div>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Obsidian Cliff and Beaver Lake.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"Obsidian there rises like basalt in vertical columns
many hundreds of feet high, and countless huge
masses had fallen from this utterly impassable mountain
into the hissing hot spring margin of an equally
impassable lake, without either Indian or game trail
over the glistering fragments of Nature&rsquo;s glass, sure
to severely lacerate. As this glass barricade sloped
from some 200 or 300 feet high against the cliff at an
angle of some 45&#176; to the lake, we&mdash;with the slivered
fragments of timber thrown from the heights&mdash;with
huge fires, heated and expanded, and then men, well
screened by blankets held by others, by dashing cold
water, suddenly cooled and fractured the large masses.
Then, with huge levers, steel bars, sledge, pick, and
shovels, and severe laceration of at least the hands
and faces of every member of the party, we rolled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
slid, crushed, and shoveled one-fourth of a mile of
good wagon road midway along the slope; it being,
so far as I am aware, the only road of native glass
upon the continent."<a name="FNanchor_BA_53" id="FNanchor_BA_53"></a>

</p>
<p>
The reader may now be inclined to take issue with our judgment
of Norris' practical turn for road building. He will at least
readily indorse our opinion of the old mountaineer&rsquo;s literary
ability. (See "<a href="#Norris_Mt">Norris Peak</a>," Appendix A.)</p></div>

<p><i>Beaver Lake</i> has its outlet opposite the base of Obsidian
Cliff. It is formed by ancient beaver dams,
now entirely overgrown with vegetation. The old
dam extends in a sinuous line entirely across the valley,
and, although apparently less than a yard thick,
is quite impervious to water. The lake is a great resort
for water fowl later in the year.</p>

<p><i>Roaring Mountain</i> (15.5 miles) is a high hill on the
left of the road, with a powerful steam vent near the
summit. Nothing which can now be heard from the
road would suggest the name.</p>

<p><i>Twin Lakes</i> (16 miles) are two exquisitely beautiful
ponds, if only seen in a good sunlight and with a
tranquil surface. The peculiar green of the water is
perhaps to be seen nowhere except in the National
Park. A most singular feature of these two lakes is
that, although so close together, they never simultaneously
exhibit the same colors.</p>

<p><i>The Frying Pan</i> (17.75 miles) is a small basin of
geyserite, on the right of the road, vigorously stewing
away in a manner which reminds one of a kitchen
spider in operation.</p>

<p>After passing Obsidian Cliff evidences of hot spring
action constantly increase, until they reach their climax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in the <i>Norris Geyser Basin</i>. There are but few other
places in the Park where the odor of sulphur is so general
and offensive as on this portion of the tourist route.</p>

<p>Norris Geyser Basin is clearly among the more recent
volcanic developments of this region. Its rapid
encroachment upon the forest growth, and the frequent
appearance of new springs and the disappearance of
others, indicate its relatively recent origin. Compared
with the Firehole Geyser Basin it is of minor importance;
but coming first to the notice of the tourist it
receives a large amount of attention. It has only one
prominent geyser, the <i>Monarch</i>, which throws a column
about 100 feet high. The <i>Constant</i> is visible
from the roadway in the bottom of a large tract of
geyserite which is unsafe for pedestrians. It makes
up in frequency of action what it lacks in power. The
most noteworthy feature of the basin has received the
appropriate name <i>Hurricane</i>. It is a prodigious steam
vent whose violent gusts bear a striking resemblance
to the driving blasts of a tempest. It also discharges
a large amount of water. The <i>Black Growler</i>, close
by the road side, is a similar phenomenon.</p>

<p>Among the less important features of this basin
may be mentioned the <i>Congress</i>, <i>Constant</i>, <i>Arsenic</i>,
<i>Echinus</i>, <i>Fearless</i>, <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Vixen</i>, <i>Minute Man</i>, and <i>Mew
Crater</i>, all geysers; the <i>Emerald Pool</i>, a quiescent
spring; and the <i>Locomotive</i> and <i>Mud Geyser</i>, boiling
springs.</p>

<p>From the Norris Hotel a drive of three miles up
the Gibbon River, on the cross road leading to the
Grand Cañon, carries the tourist to <i>Virginia Cascade</i>,
a unique and picturesque water-fall in a rocky cañon
of considerable beauty.</p>

<p class="caption2">A TOUR OF THE PARK.<br />
<i>Norris Geyser Basin to Lower Geyser Basin.</i></p>


<p>Distance, 20 miles. The road follows the Gibbon
River to within three miles of its mouth, then crosses
a point of land to the Firehole, and ascends the right
bank of the latter stream to the Lower Basin.</p>

<p><i>Gibbon Meadows</i> (3 miles) is a broad open bottom,
sometimes called Elk Park, just at the head of Gibbon
Cañon.</p>

<p>The <i>Gibbon Paint Pots</i> (4 miles) are on the left of
the road, near the head of the cañon, and one-fourth
of a mile away.</p>

<p><i>Monument Geyser Basin</i> (4.5 miles) is on the high
hill just west of the upper end of Gibbon Cañon. It
is an interesting spot, but rarely visited owing to its
inaccessibility. It was discovered and named by Col.
Norris.</p>

<p>The <i>Gibbon Cañon</i> (4.5 to 10.5 miles) affords the tourist
one of the pleasantest rides in the Park. The
mountains rise boldly from the river on either side,
and present several particularly fine views. The road
lies close to the river&rsquo;s edge, and the stream is an important
adjunct to the scenery.</p>

<p><i>Beryl Spring</i> (5 miles) is close to the road on the
side opposite the river. It boils violently and discharges
a large amount of water. The steam from it
frequently obscures the roadway.</p>

<p>The <i>Soda and Iron Spring</i> (7.5 miles), like Apollinaris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Spring already mentioned, is a frequent stopping-place
for tourists.</p>

<p><i>Gibbon Falls</i> (8 miles) is a water-fall of very
irregular outline, but withal one of much beauty.
The road hangs on the side of the cliff far above it,
and affords a lovely view of the forest-covered valley
below.</p>

<p>About half way between the point where the road
leaves the Gibbon River and that where it touches the
Firehole, is the junction of the belt line with the
western approach which enters the Park by way of
Madison Cañon. A beautiful cascade, some distance
from the tourist route, may be found on the Firehole
River about a mile above its mouth. Just as the
road (the old Norris Road) commences to descend
from the high plateau between the Gibbon and the
Firehole, a glimpse is had of the <i>Teton Mountains</i>.
They are among the most striking in the entire
Rocky Mountain Region. For half a century after
the overland journey of the Astorians, they were the
chief landmarks in that trackless wilderness, and
long bore the name of Pilot Knobs. They are distinctly
visible from every important peak in the Park,
although they are themselves outside its limits. As
seen from the point, at which we have arrived,
they are fifty miles away. They rise precipitously
from the west shore of <i>Jackson Lake</i> (also outside of
the Park) and with it form a scene of grandeur which
ought to be included in the reservation. In 1872,
Langford and Stevenson ascended the Grand Teton,
being the first white men ever to reach the
summit.<a name="FNanchor_BB_54" id="FNanchor_BB_54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BB_54" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BB_54" id="Footnote_BB_54"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BB_54"><span class="label">[BB]</span></a> Some
doubt has been expressed in recent years as to the
actual accomplishment of this feat. It probably arose from an
erroneous statement by Doctor Hayden in his report for 1872
that the granite inclosure was found &ldquo;on the top of the Grand
Teton.&rdquo; As a matter of fact it was found on a point somewhat
lower, and is clearly so stated by Mr. Langford both in an official
report to Dr. Hayden (Hayden, 1872, p. 89) and in his &ldquo;Ascent of
Mt. Hayden&rdquo; (Scribner&rsquo;s, June, 1873, p. 145). A subsequent explorer,
who ascended the mountain to the site of this principal
object of interest, came to the conclusion, doubtless as a result of
the erroneous account given by Hayden, that this was what Langford
and Stevenson called the summit. But the references above
given, and a more detailed and circumstantial account furnished
by Mr. Langford at the writer&rsquo;s request, effectually demolish
this theory.</p></div>

<p>They were astonished to find, on a point but little
lower than the main summit, a rude shelter of granite
slabs evidently put in place by human hands ages
ago.</p>

<p><i>Nez Percé Creek</i> (18 miles) is the largest branch of
the Firehole, and is of historic interest from its connection
with the Indian campaign of 1877. It forms
the north boundary of the <i>Lower Geyser Basin</i>. Two
miles beyond it is the <i>Fountain Hotel</i>.</p>

<p>To attempt any thing like a detailed description of
the Firehole Geyser regions would be intolerable alike
to reader and author. Of the objects of interest,
any one of which in other localities would attract
marked attention, there are several thousand. In the
present description, therefore, only the more important
features will be noticed&mdash;those notable objects to
see which is an indispensable part of any well ordered
tour of the Park.</p>

<p>The <i>Fountain Geyser</i> is a typical example of the
first class of geysers described in a previous chapter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Its proximity to the hotel (one-fourth mile) causes it
to be much visited.</p>

<p><i>The Mammoth Paint Pots</i>, a little way east of the
Fountain, are probably the most prominent example
of this class of phenomena in the Park.</p>

<p>The <i>Great Fountain Geyser</i> lies a mile and a half
south-east of the Fountain. It is the chief wonder
of the Lower Basin, and, in some respects, the most
remarkable geyser in the Park. Its formation is
quite unlike that of any other. At first sight the
visitor is tempted to believe that some one has here
placed a vast pedestal upon which to erect a monument.
It is a broad, circular table about two feet
high, composed entirely of hard siliceous deposit. In
its surface are numerous pools molded and ornamented
in a manner quite unapproached, at least on
so large a scale, in any other part of the Park. In
the center of the pedestal, where the monument ought
to stand, is a large irregular pool of great depth, full
of hot water, forming, to all appearances, a lovely
quiescent spring. At times of eruption, the contents
of this spring are hurled bodily upward to a height
sometimes reaching 100 feet. The torrent of water
which follows the prodigious down-pouring upon the
face of the pedestal, flows away in all directions over
the white geyserite plain. No visitor to the Yellowstone
can afford to miss the Great Fountain
Geyser.</p>

<p>In this vicinity are several of the handsomest
springs in the Park. One in particular lies just across
the hot stream which flows a little to the south of the
Great Fountain. It is shaped like an egg set endwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in the ground with the upper part of the shell broken
off. It is an exquisite trifle.</p>

<p>In a small valley, extending to the north-east from
the Great Fountain, are several objects worthy of
notice. One of these is an immense hot lake, by far
the largest in the Park. <i>Steady Geyser</i> and <i>Young
Hopeful</i>, near the head of the valley, are not remarkable
in this land of geysers.</p>

<p>The principal attraction of the locality is what has
come to be called the <i>Firehole</i>. It is at the extreme
upper end of the valley, difficult to find, and unsatisfactory
to visit when the wind agitates the water surface.
It is a large hot spring from the bottom of
which, to all appearances, a light colored flame is constantly
issuing, only to be extinguished in the water
before it reaches the surface. At times it has a distinct
ruddy tinge and it always flickers back and forth
like the lambent flame of a torch. When seen under
favorable conditions, the illusion is perfect, and the
beholder is sure that he has at last caught a glimpse
of the hidden fires which produce the weird phenomena
of this region. But it is only illusion.
Through a fissure in the rock gas or superheated
steam escapes and divides the water, just as bubbles
do on a smaller scale. The reflection from the surface
thus formed accounts for the appearance, which is intensified
by the black background formed by the sides
and bottom of the pool.</p>

<p>The Lower Geyser Basin has an area of thirty
square miles. Conspicuous among its topographical
features are the <i>Twin Buttes</i>, two prominent peaks
west of the river which dominate the entire basin. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
little way south of these is <i>Fairy Fall</i>, a pretty cascade
250 feet high.</p>

<p>There will be included in this chapter, as more
properly belonging to it than to the next, a description
of the <i>Midway Geyser Basin</i>. Its principal interest
lies in the stupendous character of its phenomena.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Excelsior Geyser.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Excelsior Geyser</i>, as a dynamic agent, has no equal
in the Park. It is really a water volcano, and its
eruptions have nothing of the characteristic display
of a genuine geyser. Its crater is a vast seething
cauldron close by the brink of the Firehole River,
into which, in non-eruptive periods even, it pours
4,000 gallons of water per minute. The shape of the
crater is irregular. Its dimensions are about 330 by
200 feet, and 20 feet deep. It was not known to be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
geyser until 1878, and did not really disclose its true
character until the winter of 1881. During the remainder
of that year and 1882, it gave continuous
exhibitions of its power. Its water column was more
than 50 feet in diameter, and at times rose to the
enormous height of 250 feet. At such times, it
doubled the volume of water in the Firehole River.
Its eruptions were frequently accompanied by the
ejection of large rocks. A second period of activity
took place in 1888, since which time it has remained
inactive.</p>

<p><i>Prismatic Lake</i> is the most perfect spring of its kind
in the world. It rests on the summit of a self-built
mound, sloping very gently in all directions. Down
this slope the overflow from the spring descends in
tiny rivulets, every-where interlaced with each other.
A map of the mound resembles a spider web, with
the spider (the spring) in the center. The pool is 250
by 300 feet in size. Over the lake hangs an ever-present
cloud of steam, which itself often bears a
crimson tinge, reflected from the waters below. The
steam unfortunately obscures the surface of the lake,
and one involuntarily wishes for a row-boat, in which
to explore its unseen portions. Wherever visible,
there is a varied and wonderful play of colors, which
fully justifies the name.</p>

<p><i>Turquoise Spring</i> is another large pool, 100 feet in
diameter, and rivals Prismatic Lake in the beauty of
its coloring.</p>

<p>The Midway Geyser Basin contains hundreds of
other springs, some of them very beautiful, but the
Basin is mainly noted for the three features just described.</p>

<p>Distance, nine miles. Road follows the Firehole
River. Midway Geyser Basin, already described, is
passed four miles out. No other object of interest is
met until the visitor actually arrives at the <i>Upper
Basin</i>.</p>

<p>This locality is probably the most popular with the
tourist of any in the Park. Its two rivals, the Grand
Cañon and the Yellowstone Lake, are so unlike it as
not to admit of any comparison. It is the home of
the genus <i>geyser</i>, as seen in its highest development.
There are fifteen examples of the first magnitude
and scores of less important ones.<a name="FNanchor_BC_55" id="FNanchor_BC_55"></a>

<p>The first important feature <i>en route</i> is the <i>Biscuit
Basin</i>, which is reached by a side road leading to the
west bank of the Firehole River. It contains a fine
geyser and several beautiful springs. The most interesting
are the <i>Jewell Geyser</i> and the <i>Sapphire Pool</i>.
Near this locality is the <i>Mystic Falls</i>, a fine cascade,
on the Little Firehole River.</p>

<p><i>Artemesia Geyser</i> comes next to the attention of the
tourist. It has been known as a geyser only since 1886.
It is on the right of the roadway, at a considerably

<p>The <i>Morning Glory</i> is a little further up stream. In
this beautiful object the quiescent pool is at its best.
Its exquisite bordering and the deep cerulean hue of
its transparent waters make it, and others like it, objects
of ceaseless admiration.</p>

<p>The <i>Fan Geyser</i> is close by the Firehole on the east
bank, not far above the Morning Glory. The <i>Riverside</i>
is also on the east bank at the point where the
road crosses the river. It is an inconspicuous object
when not in eruption, and one would scarcely suspect
it of being a geyser. It spouts obliquely across the
river, and not, like most geysers, vertically.</p>

</div>

<p>Next in order, after crossing the river to the Westbank,
is the <i>Grotto</i>, remarkable for its irregular and
cavernous crater. A little further on, close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
river, stands the broken crater of one of the Park&rsquo;s
greatest geysers, the <i>Giant</i>. Lieutenant Doane compared
its crater to a &ldquo;huge shattered horn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few hundred feet further up stream, still close
to the river, is the <i>Oblong</i>. Directly across the road,
but a short distance away, is the <i>Splendid</i>, well worthy
of its name; and near it, sometimes playing simultaneously,
is the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>To the westward from the Firehole, nearly on the divide
between it and Iron Creek, is a lovely spring, called
the <i>Punch-bowl</i>. Across the divide in the <i>Iron Creek</i>
valley is the <i>Black Sand Basin</i>, a unique but beautiful
pool. Near it is another attraction, <i>Specimen Lake</i>,
so named from an abundance of specimens of partly
petrified wood. The limit of curiosities in this direction
is <i>Emerald Pool</i>, which competent judges pronounce
to be the finest quiescent spring in the Park.</p>

<p>Returning to the Firehole by a different route, we
pass a large spring or geyser known as the <i>Three
Crater Spring</i>. Its three craters are connected by
narrow water ways, making one continuous pool,
though fed from three sources.</p>

<p>A thousand feet to the north, stands the most imposing
crater in the Park, that of the <i>Castle</i> geyser.
It is frequently seen in moderate eruption, but rarely
when doing its best. As ordinarily seen, it throws
a column of water only 50 or 60 feet, but at times it
plays as high as 150 or 200 feet.</p>

<p>Crossing the river to its right bank, nearly opposite
the Castle, there are found within a narrow compass
three noted geysers, the <i>Sawmill</i>, <i>Turban</i>, and <i>Grand</i>.
Of these, the last is by far the finest, and ranks among
the very greatest geysers in the world. It was not
seen by the Washburn Party, in 1870, but it seems to
have been the first geyser to welcome to the Upper
Basin the Hayden and Barlow parties in 1871. Captain
Barlow says of its eruption:<a name="FNanchor_BE_57" id="FNanchor_BE_57"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a></p>

<p>"This grand fountain continued to play for several
minutes. When dying down, I approached to obtain
a closer view of the aperture whence had issued such
a powerful stream. A sudden gush of steam drove
me away, following which the water was again impelled
upward and upward, far above the steam, till
it seemed to have lost the controlling force of gravity,
and that it would never cease to rise. The roar was
like the sound of a tornado, but there was no apparent
effort; a steady stream, very graceful and perfectly
vertical, except as a slight breeze may have
waved it to and fro. Strong and smooth, it continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to ascend like the stream from a powerful steam fire-engine.
We were all lost in astonishment at the
sudden and marvelous spectacle. The proportions of
the fountain were perfect. The enthusiasm of the
party was manifested in shouts of delight. Under
the excitement of the moment, it was estimated to be
from three to five hundred feet in height."</p>

<a href="#bibl_94">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>Further up the river on the same side and at some
distance back, are the <i>Lion</i>, <i>Lioness</i> and the two <i>Cubs</i>,
an interesting group, including one notable geyser.
Half way up a high mound of geyserite which covers
a large area on the north side of the river, is an
exquisitely beautiful formation called, from its appearance,
the <i>Sponge</i>.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">The Bee Hive Geyser.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the top of the mound is another of the great
geysers, thought by the Washburn Party to be the
greatest in the world, the <i>Giantess</i>. It belongs to the
class of fountain geysers, and when not in action
strongly resembles a quiescent spring. Its eruptions
are infrequent and irregular, but when it does play it
is a sight not to be forgotten. Mr. Langford thus describes
the first eruption known to have been seen by
white men:<a name="FNanchor_BF_58" id="FNanchor_BF_58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a></p>

<p>"We were standing on the side of the geyser nearest
the sun, the gleams of which filled the sparkling
columns of water and spray with myriad rainbows,
whose arches were constantly changing&mdash;dipping and
fluttering hither and thither, and disappearing only to
be succeeded by others, again and again, amid the
aqueous column, while the minute globules, into which
the spent jets were diffused when falling, sparkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
like a shower of diamonds, and around every shadow
which the denser clouds of vapor, interrupting the
sun&rsquo;s rays, cast upon the column, could be seen a
luminous circle, radiant with all the colors of the
prism, and resembling the halo of glory represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in paintings as encircling the head of Divinity. All
that we had previously witnessed seemed tame in
comparison with the perfect grandeur and beauty of
this display."</p>

Wonders of the Yellowstone.&rdquo; See <a href="#bibl_129">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>Between the Giantess and the river is the <i>Bee Hive</i>,
also one of the most prominent geysers. The symmetry
of its cone is only surpassed by the regularity of
its water column. From an artistic point of view it
is the most perfect geyser in the Park. Its slender jet
attains a great height and is vertical and symmetrical
throughout.</p>

<p>Crossing again to the west bank of the stream and
ascending to the very head of the basin, we come to
the last and most important of the geysers, <i>Old Faithful</i>.
Any other geyser, any five other geysers, could
be erased from the list better than part with Old
Faithful. The Giant, Giantess, Grand, Splendid, and
Excelsior, have more powerful eruptions. The Bee
Hive is more artistic. The Great Fountain has a more
wonderful formation. But Old Faithful partakes in
a high degree of all these characteristics, and, in addition,
has the invaluable quality of uniform periodicity
of action. It is in fact the most perfect of all known
geysers.</p>

<p>To it fell the honor of welcoming civilized man to
this region. It was the first geyser named. It stands
at the head of the basin and has been happily called
&ldquo;The Guardian of the Valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is located in the center of an oblong mound, 145
by 215 feet at the base, 20 by 54 feet at the summit,
and about 12 feet high. The tube, which seems to
have originated in a fissure in the rock, has an inside
measurement of 2 by 6 feet.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The ornamentation about the crater, though limited
in extent, is nowhere surpassed for beauty of form
and color. In particular, the three small pools on the
north side of the crater and very close to it are specimens
of the most remarkable handiwork which Nature
has lavished upon this region. A singular fact is that
the waters in these three pools, although so close together
as apparently to be subject to the same conditions,
are of different colors. Speaking of these marvelous
appearances, Lieutenant Doane says:<a name="FNanchor_BG_59" id="FNanchor_BG_59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BG_59" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;One instinctively touches the hot ledges with his
hands, and sounds with a stick the depths of the
cavities in the slope, in utter doubt of the evidence
of his own eyes&#8230;. It is the most lovely inanimate
object in existence.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BG_59" id="Footnote_BG_59"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BG_59"><span class="label">[BG]</span></a> Page 29,
&ldquo;Yellowstone Expedition of 1870.&rdquo; See <a href="#bibl_136">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>In its eruption this geyser is equally fascinating.
It always gives ample warning, and visitors have time
to station themselves where the view will be most
perfect. The graceful column rises, at first with apparent
effort, but later with evident ease, to a height
of 150 feet. The noise is simply that of a jet of water
from an ordinary hose, only in intensity corresponding
to the greater flow. The steam, when carried
laterally by a gentle breeze, unfurls itself like an enormous
flag from its watery standard. The water is of
crystal clearness and the myriad drops float in the air
with all manner of brilliant effects. To quote Lieutenant
Doane again:</p>

<p>"Rainbows play around the tremendous fountain,
the waters of which fall about the basin in showers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
brilliants, and then rush steaming down the slopes to
the river."</p>

<p>The uniform periodicity of this geyser is its most
wonderful and most useful characteristic. It never
fails the tourist. With an average interval of sixty-five
minutes, it varies but little either way. Night
and day, winter and summer, seen or unseen, this
&ldquo;tremendous fountain&rdquo; has been playing for untold
ages. Only in thousands of years can its lifetime be
reckoned; for the visible work it has wrought, and its
present infinitely slow rate of progress, fairly appall
the inquirer who seeks to learn its real age.</p>

<p>It is worth while, however, to note the enormous
work which this geyser daily performs. A conservative
estimate, based upon an extended series of observations
made in 1878 by the United States Geological
Survey, shows that the outpour for an average eruption
is not less 1,500,000 gallons, which gives 33,225,000
gallons per day. This would supply a city of
300,000 inhabitants. The combination of conditions
by which the supply of heat and water, and the form
of tube, are so perfectly adapted to their work, that
even a chronometer is scarcely more regular in its action,
is one of the miracles of nature.</p>

<i>Upper Geyser Basin to the Yellowstone Lake.</i></p>


<p>Distance, nineteen miles. The route ascends the
Firehole River to the mouth of Spring Creek, which
stream it follows to the Continental Divide. For
seven miles it then lies on the Pacific slope, after
which it descends the mountains to the Yellowstone
Lake. The drive is one of the most pleasant in the
Park, and the scenery is unconventional and wild.</p>

<p><i>Kepler Cascade</i> (1.25 miles) is a fascinating water-fall.
Lieutenant Doane, who first wrote of it,
says:<a name="FNanchor_BH_60" id="FNanchor_BH_60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;These pretty little falls, if located on an eastern
stream, would be celebrated in history and song;
here, amid objects so grand as to strain conception
and stagger belief, they were passed without a halt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We counsel the tourist not to so pass them.</p>

<p>Half a mile up the Firehole, above the mouth of
Spring Creek, is the <i>Lone Star Geyser</i> (4 miles).
This geyser is conspicuous chiefly for its fine cone.
It plays frequently to a height of 40 or 50 feet.</p>

<p><a name="Madison_Lake" id="Madison_Lake"></a><i>Madison Lake</i>, ten miles further up the valley, is
the ultimate lake source of the Madison River. This
lake, with possibly the exception of Red Rock Lake,
the source of the Jefferson, is further from the sea by
direct water-course than any other lake on the globe.</p>

<p>Returning down the Firehole, we enter the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of <i>Spring Creek Cañon</i> (3.5 miles), which the road
traverses for a distance of two and one-half miles.
This narrow, winding, rocky cañon, under the shadow
of the Continental Divide, is full of picturesque turns
and surprises.</p>

<p>The first crossing of the <i>Continental Divide</i> (8.5

in by precipitous cliffs, inclosing a lily-covered pond,
<i>Isa Lake</i>, which rests squarely upon the doubtful

<p><i>Shoshone Point</i> (10.5 miles) is in the center of the
large amphitheater-shaped tract which is drained by
the branches of <i>De Lacy Creek</i>. It overlooks <i>Shoshone
Lake</i> and the broad basin surrounding it, and gives a
second glimpse of the Teton Mountains.</p>

</div>

<p>Shoshone Lake is a lovely body of water, with an
area of twelve square miles and a most picturesque
shore line. On its west shore is a geyser basin, second
in importance only to those on the Firehole. Among
its many interesting features may be mentioned the
<i>Union Geyser</i>, of which the middle crater plays to a
height of 100 feet; and the <i>Bronze Geyser</i>, very striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
because of the perfect metallic luster of its formation.</p>

<p>From Shoshone Point, the road again ascends to
the Continental Divide, and then drops down the
Atlantic slope toward the Yellowstone Valley.</p>

<p><i>Lake View</i> (18 miles) is at a point where a sudden
turn in the forest road brings the tourist, quite without
warning, in full view of one of the most striking
water landscapes in the world. The whole vista of
the <i>Yellowstone Lake</i> is spread out before him, still
300 feet below where he is standing. Far to the
right and left, along the distant eastern shore, extends
the <i>Absaroka Range</i> of mountains, many of its summits
still capped with snow. Every-where the dark
pine forests come down to the water&rsquo;s edge, in fine
contrast with the silver surface of the lake. The
sparkling of the waves, the passage of the cloud
shadows, and, in sheltered coves, the tranquil mirror
of the waters, all combine to make the picture one to
be long remembered.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone Lake is about 7,741 feet, nearly a
mile and a half, above the level of the sea. It has a
shore line of 100 miles, and an area of 139 square
miles. Its maximum depth is 300 feet, and its average
depth about 30 feet. It is fed almost entirely
from the springs and snow drifts of the Absaroka
Range. Its waters are icy cold, clear and transparent
to great depths, and literally swarm with trout. It is
subject to heavy south-west winds, and at times is
lashed into tempestuous seas.</p>

<p>The shape of the lake was compared by the early
explorers to the form of the human hand. The resemblance
is exceedingly remote, and one writer has well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
observed that only the hand of a base ball player who
has stood for years behind the bat could satisfy the
comparison. The &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; have now been generally
dropped from the maps and replaced by the usual
names; but &ldquo;West Thumb&rdquo; seems to have become
a fixture.</p>

<p>Surpassing the Yellowstone Lake both in area and
altitude there are but few lakes in the world. Lake
Titticaca, in Peru, and one or two others in the less
explored regions of the Andes; and also a few lakes
on the lofty table-land of Thibet, comprise the number.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone Lake has been a theme of enthusiastic
praise by all who have ever seen it; but what
seems to us the most exquisite tribute it has ever received
is to be found in the farewell words of Mr.
Folsom, when, in 1869, he regretfully turned away
from its western shore into the deep forests which surround
it:<a name="FNanchor_BI_61" id="FNanchor_BI_61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BI_61" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a></p>

<p>"As we were about departing on our homeward
trip, we ascended the summit of a neighboring hill
and took a final look at Yellowstone Lake. Nestled
among the forest-crowned hills which bounded our
visions, lay this inland sea, its crystal waves dancing
and sparkling in the sunlight as if laughing with joy
for their wild freedom. It is a scene of transcendent
beauty which has been viewed by but few white men,
and we felt glad to have looked upon it before its
primeval solitude should be broken by the crowds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
pleasure seekers which at no distant day will throng
its shores."</p>

<p>On the west shore of the lake is an extensive and
important hot springs basin. The principal features
are the <i>Paint Pots</i>, not inferior to those near the Fountain
Hotel; two of the largest and most beautiful
quiescent springs in the Park; the <i>Lake Shore</i> Geyser,
which plays frequently to a height of about 30
feet; an unnamed geyser of considerable power but
of very infrequent action; and the celebrated <i>Fishing
Cone</i> where unfortunate trout find catching and cooking
painfully near together.</p>

<p>From the west shore of the lake a visit can be advantageously
made to <i>Hart Lake</i> and <i>Mount Sheridan</i>.
The lake is probably the prettiest in the Park. Near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it, on the tributary <i>Witch Creek</i>, is a small but important
geyser basin. The principal features are the
<i>Deluge</i>, <i>Spike</i> and <i>Rustic</i> geysers, and the <i>Fissure
Group</i> of springs. The Rustic Geyser is remarkable
in having about it a cordon of logs, evidently placed
there by the Indians or white men many years ago.
The logs are completely incrusted with the deposits of
the springs.</p>

<p>Mt. Sheridan would rank with Mt. Washburn as a
popular peak for mountain climbers were it only
more accessible. No summit in the Park affords a
finer prospect.</p>

<p>From the west shore to the Lake Outlet the tourist
may travel either by stage around the border of the
lake, or by boat across it. If he does not want to
miss one of the notable features of the tour he will
not omit the boat ride. In fact, a steamboat ride, at
an altitude more than a quarter of a mile greater
than that of the summit of Mt. Washington is not an
every day diversion. From near the center of the
lake the view is surpassingly fine. To the south
and south-west the long arms of the lake penetrate
the dark forest-crowned hills, which are but stepping
stones to the lofty mountains behind them. Far
beyond these may again be seen for the third time the
familiar peaks of the Tetons. All along the eastern
shore stand the serried peaks of the Absaroka Range,
the boundary which nature has so well established
along the eastern border of the Park. A notable
feature of this range is the profile of a human face
formed by the superimposed contours of two mountains,
one several miles behind the other. The best
effect is had from points between <i>Stevenson Island</i> and
the <i>Lake Hotel</i>. The face is looking directly upward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
A similar profile, noted by the early explorers from
the summit of Mt. Washburn, and nearly in the same
locality as this, although of course not the same
feature, was called by them the &ldquo;Giant&rsquo;s Face,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Old Man of the Mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the north-east shore of the lake are <i>Steamboat
Spring</i>, and other thermal phenomena worth visiting.
From <i>Bridge Bay</i> at the north-west of the lake, a
trip of a mile will take the tourist to an extremely interesting
freak of nature in the form of a <i>Natural
Bridge</i> over a small tributary of Bridge Creek. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
arch is forty-one feet high with a thirty foot span.
As seen from the down stream side it is very regular
and symmetrical.</p>

<p>Some twenty miles above the head of the lake is the
celebrated <i>Two-Ocean Pass</i>, long known to the early
trappers. It is probably the most remarkable example
of such a phenomenon in the world. Although the fact
of its existence was asserted and stoutly maintained
by Bridger for many years prior to the discovery of
the Park region, it was generally disbelieved until
Captain Jones crossed the pass in 1873. It has since
been visited and described by Hayden in 1878, by
Hague in 1884, and by Prof. Evermann of the United
States Fish Commission in 1891. The following facts
and map are taken from Prof. Evermann&rsquo;s report:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 494px;">

<div class="fig_text_lf"><i>Terry Engr. Co.</i></div>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Sketch of Two-Ocean Pass.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The pass is in a nearly level grassy park hemmed
in by the surrounding hills, and is 8,150 feet above the
level of the sea. Its extreme length is about one mile
and its extreme breadth about three-fourths of a mile.
From the north a stream issues from a cañon, <i>a</i>, and
divides at <i>b</i>, part flowing to Atlantic Creek and part
to Pacific Creek. A similar stream, <i>c</i>, with a similar
division, <i>d</i>, comes from the south. At extreme low
water, these divisions may possibly disappear and all
the water flow either one way or the other. But at
ordinary and high stages the water flows both ways.
These streams are by no means insignificant rivulets,
but substantial water-courses capable of affording
passage to fish of considerable size.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the very interesting phenomenon
of a single stream upon the summit of the continent
dividing and flowing part one way and part the
other, and forming a continuous water connection between
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans over a distance
of nearly 6,000 miles.</p>

<p>A most singular and interesting acoustic phenomenon
of this region, although rarely noticed by tourists,
is the occurrence of strange and indefinable overhead
sounds. They have long been noted by explorers, but
only in the vicinity of Shoshone and Yellowstone
Lakes. They seem to occur in the morning, and to
last only for a moment. They have an apparent motion
through the air, the general direction noted by
writers being from north to south. The following descriptions
are from the pens of those who have given
some study to these strange sounds. Prof. S. A.
Forbes says:</p>

<p>"It put me in mind of the vibrating clang of a harp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
lightly and rapidly touched high up above the tree
tops, or the sound of many telegraph wires swinging
regularly and rapidly in the wind, or, more rarely, of
faintly heard voices answering each other overhead.
It begins softly in the remote distance, draws rapidly
near with louder and louder throbs of sound, and dies
away in the opposite direction; or it may seem to
wander irregularly about, the whole passage lasting
from a few seconds to half a minute or
more."<a name="FNanchor_BJ_62" id="FNanchor_BJ_62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BJ_62" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BJ_62" id="Footnote_BJ_62"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BJ_62"><span class="label">[BJ]</span></a> &ldquo;Overhead
sounds in the vicinity of Yellowstone Lake.&rdquo;
See <a href="#bibl_85">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Edwin Linton thus describes it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed to begin at a distance, grow louder overhead
where it filled the upper air, and suggested a
medley of wind in the tops of pine trees, and in telegraph
wires, the echo of bells after being repeated several
times, the humming of a swarm of bees, and two
or three other less definite sources of sound, making
in all a composite which was not loud, but easily
recognized, and not at all likely to be mistaken for
any other sound in these mountain
solitudes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BK_63" id="FNanchor_BK_63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BK_63" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a></p>

sounds in the vicinity of Yellowstone Lake.&rdquo;
See <a href="#bibl_85">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>No rational explanation has ever been advanced for
this remarkable phenomenon. Its weird character is
in keeping with its strange surroundings. In other
lands and times it would have been an object of superstitious
reverence or dread, and would have found a
permanent place in the traditions of the people.</p>

<p><i>Mud Volcano</i> (7.5 miles) is a weird, uncanny object,
but, nevertheless, a very fascinating feature and one
which the tourist should stop and examine. It is an
immense funnel-shaped crater in the side of a considerable
hill on the west bank of the river. The mud
rises some distance above a large steam vent in the
side of the crater next the hill, and chokes the vent
until the steam has accumulated in sufficient force to
lift the superincumbent mass. As the imprisoned
steam bursts forth, it hurls the mud with great violence
against the opposite side of the crater, making
a heavy thud which is audible for half a mile. These
outbursts take place every few seconds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>A striking example of the strange commingling of
dissimilar features in the hot springs districts is found
in the <i>Grotto</i>, a spring of perfectly clear water, not far
from the Mud Volcano. It is acted upon by the
steam in a manner precisely similar to that of the
Mud Volcano, but its waters issue directly from the
rock, and are entirely clear.</p>

<p><i>Mud Geyser</i>, now rarely seen in action, was an important
geyser twenty years ago. As it became infrequent
in its eruptions, and tourists rarely saw them,
the name was unconsciously, but mistakenly, transferred
to the Mud Volcano, which has none of the
characteristics of a geyser.</p>

<p>The locality where these objects are found has considerable
historic interest. The ford just below the
Mud Volcano was long used by the hunters and trappers
who passed up and down the river. Folsom
crossed it in 1869, and the Washburn party in 1870.
The Nez Percés encamped here two days, in 1877, and
here transpired a part of the episode elsewhere related.
Hither came General Howard, in pursuit of
the Indians, although he did not cross the river at
this point.</p>

<p><i>Trout Creek</i> (9.5 miles) has a most peculiar feature,
where the tourist route crosses it, in the form of an
extraordinary doubling of the channel upon itself.
It was this stream which Mr. Hedges, in 1870, called
&ldquo;a lazy creek coiled up like a monster serpent under
a sand bluff.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Sulphur Mountain</i> (11.5 miles) is half a mile back
from the main route. At its base is a remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<i>Sulphur Spring</i>, always in a state of violent ebullition,
although discharging only a small amount of
water. This is highly impregnated with sulphur,
and leaves a yellow border along the rivulet which
carries it away. The best time to visit Sulphur Mountain
is on a clear sharp morning. The myriad little
steam vents which cover the surface of the hill are
then very noticeable.</p>

<p><i>Hayden Valley</i> is a broad grassy expanse extending
several miles along the river and far back from it on
the west side. It was once a vast arm of the lake.
It comprises some fifty square miles, and is an important
winter range for the Park buffalo and elk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The river along the lower portion of this valley is
the most tranquil and lovely stream imaginable&mdash;broad,
deep, transparent, flowing peacefully around
its graceful curves, disturbed only by the splashing
trout which inhabit it. There is little here to suggest
the mad turmoil into which it is soon to plunge. At
a point fifteen miles below the lake, the river and road
are forced by the narrowing valley close together.
The stream becomes suddenly broken into turbulent
cascades as it dashes violently between precipitous
banks and among massive boulders.</p>

<p>The road also becomes decidedly picturesque. Hung
up on the almost vertical cliff overlooking the rapids,
it forms a short drive unsurpassed for interest anywhere
else in the Park. At one point it crosses a
deep ravine over the highest bridge on the road system.
Just to the left of this bridge, in the bottom of
the ravine, still stands the tree upon which some
white man carved his initials away back in 1819.</p>

<p>Half a mile below the head of the rapids, the river
suddenly contracts its width to less than fifty feet,
turns abruptly to the right, and disappears. It is the
<i>Upper Fall</i> of the Yellowstone. In some respects,
this cataract differs from almost any other. Although
the ledge over which it falls is apparently perpendicular,
the velocity of flow at the crest of the fall is
so great that the water pours over as if on the surface
of a wheel. Visitors at Niagara have noticed the difference
in this respect between the almost vertical
sheet of water on the American side and the well-rounded
flow at the apex of the Horseshoe Fall. The
height of the Upper Fall of the Yellowstone is 112
feet.</p>

<p>From this point, the character of the scenery is wild
and rugged. A ride of a few hundred yards brings
the tourist to a sharp bend in the road, which at once
unfolds to him the whole vista of the <i>Grand Cañon of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span><i>the Yellowstone</i>. The sight is so impressive and absorbing
that the chances are he will cross the ravine
of <i>Cascade Creek</i> without even noticing the lovely
<i>Crystal Falls</i> almost beneath his feet.</p>

<p>The <i>Cañon Hotel</i> is half a mile beyond Cascade
Creek, in an open park, a little way back from the
brink of the Cañon. From its porch, the crest of the
Upper Fall can be seen, and the roar of both cataracts
is distinctly audible. This hotel and that at the
lake are the most desirable in the Park for a protracted
stay.</p>

<p>The Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone is acknowledged
by all beholders to stand without parallel
among the natural wonders of the globe. Other
cañons, the Yosemite, for example, have greater
depths and more imposing walls; but there are none
which, in the words of Captain Ludlow, &ldquo;unite more
potently the two requisites of majesty and beauty.&rdquo;
The cañon itself is vast. A cross-section in the largest
part measures 2,000 feet at the top, 200 feet at the
bottom, and is 1,200 feet deep, giving an area of over
three acres. But such a gorge in any other part of
the world would not be what it is here. Its sides
would soon be clothed with vegetation, and it would
be simply an immense valley, beautiful, no doubt, but
not what it is in the Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<p>There are three distinct features which unite their
peculiar glories to enhance the beauty of this cañon.
These are the cañon itself, the water-fall at its head,
and the river below.</p>

<p>It is the volcanic rock through which the river has
cut its way that gives the Grand Cañon its distinctive
character. It is preëminently a cañon of color. The
hue has no existence which can not be found there.
"Hung up and let down and spread abroad are all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
colors of the land, sea, and sky," says Talmage, without
hyperbole. From the dark, forest-bordered brink,
the sides descend for the most part with the natural
slope of the loose rock, but frequently broken by vertical
ledges and isolated pinnacles, which give a castellated
and romantic air to the whole. Eagles build
their nests here, and soar midway through the vast
chasm, far below the beholder. The more prominent
of the projecting ledges cause many turns in the general
course of the cañon, and give numerous vantage
places for sight-seeing. <i>Lookout Point</i> is one of these,
half a mile below the Lower Falls. <i>Inspiration Point</i>,
some two miles farther down, is another. The gorgeous
coloring of the cañon walls does not extend
through its entire length of twenty miles. In the
lower portion, the forests have crept well down to the
water&rsquo;s edge. Still, it is every-where an extremely
beautiful and impressive sight. Along the bottom of
the cañon, numerous steam vents can be seen, one of
which, it is said, exhibits geyseric action. In places,
the cañon walls almost shut out the light of day from
the extreme bottom. Lieutenant Doane, who made
the dangerous descent several miles below the Falls,
records that "it was about three o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, and
stars could be distinctly seen, so much of the sunlight
was cut off from entering the chasm."</p>

<p>The <i>Lower Fall</i> of the Yellowstone must be placed
in the front rank of similar phenomena. It carries
not one-twentieth the water of Niagara, but Niagara
is in no single part so beautiful. Its height is 310
feet. Its descent is very regular, slightly broken by
a point of rock on the right bank. A third of the fall
is hidden behind the vast cloud of spray which forever
conceals the mad play of the waters beneath;
but the mighty turmoil of that recess in the rocks
may be judged from the deep-toned thunder which
rises in ceaseless cadence and jars the air for miles
around.</p>

<p>To many visitors the stream far down in the bottom
of the cañon is the crowning beauty of the whole
scene. It is so distant that its rapid course is diminished
to the gentlest movement, and its continuous
roar to the subdued murmur of the pine forests. Its
winding, hide-and-seek course, its dark surface when
the shadows cover it, its bright limpid green under the
play of the sunlight, its ever recurring foam-white
patches, and particularly its display of life where all
around is silent and motionless, make it a thing of
entrancing beauty to all who behold it.</p>

<p>It is not strange that this cañon has been a theme
for writer, painter, and photographer, from its discovery
to the present time. But at first thought it is
strange that all attempts to portray its beauties are
less satisfactory than those pertaining to any other
feature of the Park. The artist Moran acknowledged
that &ldquo;its beautiful tints were beyond the reach of human
art;&rdquo; and General Sherman said of this artist&rsquo;s
celebrated effort: &ldquo;The painting by Moran in the
Capitol is good, but painting and words are unequal
to the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In photography, the number of pictures by professional
and amateur artists, that have been made of
this cañon is prodigious. But photography can only
reproduce the form, it is powerless in the presence of
such an array of colors as here exists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The pen itself is scarcely more effective than the
pencil or camera. Folsom, who first wrote of the
cañon, frankly owned that &ldquo;language is entirely inadequate
to convey a just conception of the awful
grandeur and sublimity of this masterpiece of nature&rsquo;s
handiwork.&rdquo; Time has shown this confession to be
substantially true. From the clumsy work of the casual
newspaper scribe, to the giddy flight of that eminent
clergyman, who fancied he saw in this cañon a
suitable hall for the great judgment, with the nations
of the earth filing along the bottom upon waters &ldquo;congealed
and transfixed with the agitations of that day,&rdquo;
all descriptions do injustice to their subject. They
fall short of their mark or overreach it. They are not
true to nature. We shall therefore pass them by, with
one exception, and shall commend our readers to a
study of this great wonderwork from the pine-clad
verge of the Grand Cañon itself.</p>

<p>The exception to which reference is made relates to
the Grand Cañon in winter. It has been explained
in another place why it is that the winter scenery of the
Park must ever remain a sealed book except to those
few hardy adventurers who are willing to brave the
perils of winter travel in that region. It is a pleasure,
therefore, to give at first hand what one of those intrepid
spirits felt as he stood upon Lookout Point less
than two years ago, and saw the famous cañon clad in
its annual mantle of white. He says:<a name="FNanchor_BO_67" id="FNanchor_BO_67"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BO_67" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a></p>

<p>"I suppose thousands have stood grasping the stem
of that same sturdy, ragged tree, and have looked in silence
as we did. They have seen the cañon in summer,
and I wish they might all see it also in the depth of winter.
Now the glorious colors of the walls were gone,
but the peaks and crosses and pinnacles were there, free
of all color, but done in clean, perfect white. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was &ldquo;frozen music&rdquo;&mdash;the diapason of nature&rsquo;s mightiest
and most mysterious anthem all congealed in
white, visible, palpable, authentic. No thinking man

</div>

<p>Back perhaps a quarter of a mile from Inspiration
Point, but within fifty yards of the brink of the cañon,
is a huge rectangular block of granite which rests
alone in the woods, a most singular and striking object.
It is evidently an intruder in unfamiliar territory,
for there is not a particle of granite outcrop
known to exist within twenty miles. It must
have been transported to this place from some distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
quarry by the powerful agencies of the Glacial
Epoch.</p>

<p>To the eastward from the Grand Cañon are several
interesting hot springs districts, and there is one
notable group at the southern base of Mount Washburn.</p>

<a href="#Footnote_BP_68" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a> From the Grand
Cañon north lies the true scenic portion of the tourist
route. Hitherto, the main attractions have been the
geyser basins, the Yellowstone Lake, and the Grand
Cañon. The tourist has probably frequently expressed
his disappointment at not finding as much rugged
mountain scenery as he had expected. But from this
point on he will have no cause to complain.</p>

distances given in this chapter are only approximate, the
surveys for a wagon road from the cañon to Mammoth Hot Springs,
via Mt. Washburn, not being yet completed.</p></div>

<p><i>Mt. Washburn</i> (12 miles) is the most celebrated
peak in the Park, and the first to receive its present
name. Its prominence justifies its notoriety, but the
real cause of it is the fact that for eight years the
main tourist route lay across it. From its summit the
Washburn party received the first definite confirmation
of the truth of the rumors that led them into
this region. All reports and magazine articles which
first gave a knowledge of the Park to the world were
written by persons who had crossed this mountain.
As the view from its summit is comprehensive and
grand, covering almost the entire Park, it of course
figured prominently in all narratives. Tourists fell
into the custom established by the first explorers, of
leaving their cards in a receptacle for the purpose on
the summit. Many eminent names are to be seen
there. It is a matter for congratulation that the progress
upon the road system will soon restore this mountain
to its former place in the tourist route.</p>

<p><i>Tower Falls</i> (20 miles) is perhaps the most graceful
cataract in the Park, and should never be passed without
a visit. It is on Tower Creek only a short distance
back from the Yellowstone. Lieutenant Doane
says in his report:<a name="FNanchor_BQ_69" id="FNanchor_BQ_69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BQ_69" class="fnanchor">[BQ]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more chastely beautiful than this
lovely cascade, hidden away in the dim light of overshadowing
rocks and woods, its very voice hushed to
a low murmur, unheard at the distance of a few hundred
yards. Thousands might pass by within a half
mile and not dream of its existence; but once seen,
it passes to the list of most pleasant memories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Near this point on both banks of the river are
numerous sulphur fumaroles, the last evidence of subterraneous
fire which the tourist will encounter on his
trip. A little way above the mouth of the stream is
the old Bannock Ford, the same by which Colter
crossed in 1807. It is the only practicable ford within
twenty miles in either direction.</p>

<p><i>Junction Butte</i> (22 miles) is on the right bank of the
Yellowstone in the angle between that stream and the
East Fork. It stands not only near one of the most
important stream junctions in the Park, but also near
a not less important road junction. It is a very striking
object. Its summit is nearly flat, and its sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
near the summit are perpendicular. Below this is a
steep slope composed of enormous masses of finely
broken stone disengaged from the cliff by the force
of the elements. It is a fitting landmark for its important
situation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">First Bridge Over the Yellowstone.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Baronett&rsquo;s Bridge</i> crosses the river immediately
opposite Junction Butte. It is the first and only
bridge yet (1895) built across the Yellowstone within
the limits of the Park. It was built by the well
known mountaineer, J. H. Baronett, in the spring of
1871, for the convenience of Clark&rsquo;s Fork miners. It
was partially destroyed by the Nez Percés in 1877, but
was repaired by Howard&rsquo;s command, and still further
repaired the following year by Baronett and Norris.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
In 1880, it was replaced by a more substantial structure.
At present it enjoys the unique distinction of
being a private toll bridge on a government reservation.</p>

<p><i>Junction Valley</i>,<a name="FNanchor_BR_70" id="FNanchor_BR_70"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BR_70" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a> described elsewhere, is a name
properly applicable to the valley inclosed by Crescent
Hill, Mt. Washburn, Specimen Ridge, and the mountains
north of Lamar River. This valley, and those
of tributary streams, form the largest treeless tract in
the Park.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BR_70" id="Footnote_BR_70"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BR_70"><span class="label">[BR]</span></a> The
popular name for this locality is &ldquo;Yancey&rsquo;s,&rdquo; from John
Yancey, who has long held a lease in the Valley of Lost Creek at
the foot of Crescent Hill. He has kept a sort of hotel or stopping
place for the convenience of travelers to Cooke City, as well
as for tourists between the Grand Cañon and Mammoth Hot
Springs by way of Mt. Washburn.</p></div>

<p><i>Amethyst Mountain</i>, <i>Specimen Ridge</i>, and the <i>Fossil
Forests</i> are names at once suggestive of the action of
geological agencies which have been described in another
chapter. Amethyst, limpid quartz, milky quartz,
chalcedony, carnelian, prase, chrysoprase, banded
agate, flint, jaspers of all colors, semi-opal, calcite, and
many other varieties abound. The forest petrifactions
present one of the most interesting scientific problems
in the Park.</p>

<p>The <i>Lamar River Cañon</i> (7 miles above Junction
Butte) is a gorge about half a mile long, the chief
characteristic of which is the enormous number and
size of boulders which have fallen into it. These are
almost spherical in shape, and, in many instances, are
as smooth as if from the hand of a stone glazier.
They are piled up like billiard balls, to such a depth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that the stream flows entirely out of sight beneath
them.<a name="FNanchor_BS_71" id="FNanchor_BS_71"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BS_71" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BS_71" id="Footnote_BS_71"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BS_71"><span class="label">[BS]</span></a> Above
the head of this cañon are the remains of what seems
to have once been a bridge, but no record concerning it has come
to the writer&rsquo;s notice.</p></div>

<p><i>Soda Butte</i> (15 miles above Junction Butte) and
<i>Soda Butte Cañon</i>, extending from Soda Butte to
Cooke City, are worthy of much attention. The
cañon in particular is as wonderful a bit of scenery as
any mountains afford. It is every-where rugged, majestic
and imposing, and there is no point in its
twelve miles length that does not present a landscape
deserving of the tourist&rsquo;s careful study. Mr. W. H.
Weed, who has done much work in the Park, and
particularly in this section, says of this valley:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the eastward Soda Butte Valley penetrates the
heart of the rugged Sierra, whose high peaks rise in
castellated forms. The visitor, disappointed perhaps
in the mountain scenery of the Park, after traveling
the usual route over the dusty roads of the Park plateau,
will here find mountain views that are sure to
fulfill his expectations, while the neighborhood is not
lacking in curiosities that in another land would attract
visitors from far and wide.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BT_72" id="FNanchor_BT_72"></a>

<p><i>Cooke City</i> is a small mining camp just outside the
north-east corner of the Park in the midst of the
Clark&rsquo;s Fork mining district. It is of interest in this
connection only on account of its notorious hostility
to the Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<p><i>Death Gulch</i>, reputed to exist in the valley of Cache
Creek, is like Bridger&rsquo;s Glass Mountain, mostly a
product of the imagination. It seems that some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
animals were once poisoned there, and that later, certain
explorers, finding them, attributed their death to
an escape of carbonic acid gas from the earth. The
name has found its way into maps and reports of
highest authority, but the object itself has no existence.</p>

<p>The <i>Hoodoo Region</i> is near the head of Miller Creek
just outside the original reservation, although within
the Forest Reserve addition. This mysterious region
furnishes probably the most striking example in
existence of the effects of erosion and wind action
upon masses of moderately soft rock. The region
was discovered by miners in 1870, but was first explored
and reported upon by Colonel Norris in 1880,
who thus describes it:<a name="FNanchor_BU_73" id="FNanchor_BU_73"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BU_73" class="fnanchor">[BU]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly every form, animate or inanimate, real or
chimerical, ever actually seen or conjured by the imagination,
may here be observed. Language does not
suffice to properly describe these peculiar formations;
sketches may probably do something, and photographs
more, to convey a conception of their remarkable
character, but actual observation is absolutely necessary
to adequately impress the mind with the wild,
unearthly appearance of these eroded Hoodoos of the
Goblin Land. These monuments are from fifty to
two or three hundred feet in height, with narrow,
tortuous passages between them, which sometimes are
tunnels through permanent snow or ice fields, where
the big-horn sheep hide in safety; while the ceaseless
but ever changing moans of the wild winds seem to
chant fitting requiems to these gnome-like monuments
of the legendary Indian gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Returning to Junction Valley, and following down
the Yellowstone, the tourist soon arrives at the <i>Third
Cañon</i> (the third above Livingston, the Grand Cañon
being fourth), which extends from the eastern limit
of Junction Valley to the north boundary of the Park.
Located anywhere else, away from the overshadowing
splendor of the Grand Cañon, it would become celebrated.
Some of the views, particularly from the
high ground north of Mt. Everts, overlooking by
nearly 2,000 feet the vast chasm through which the
turbulent river flows, are among the most impressive
in the entire region.</p>

<p>From the immediate vicinity of the Third Cañon,
the road crosses the plateau of Black Tail Deer Creek
to the valley of the East Gardiner. The tour terminates
at Mammoth Hot Springs.</p>

<p class="caption2">HOSTILITY TO THE PARK.</p>


<p>From what has been thus far set forth the reader can
not have failed to observe how fortunate have been the
events, both in prehistoric and in recent times, which
have made the Yellowstone National Park what it is
to-day. In the course of long ages Nature developed
this region into its present attractive form, and filled
it with wonders which will never fail to command the
admiration of men. She placed it upon the very apex
of the continent, and made of it an inexhaustible reservoir
of water for a perennial supply to the parched
and rainless desert around it. She interspersed among
its forests an abundance of parks and valleys, where
the native fauna of the continent, elsewhere fast passing
away, may find protection in all future time. With
infinite foresight she made it unfit for the gainful occupations
of men, so that every motive to appropriate
it for private use is removed.</p>

<p>For many years after the white man first looked
within its borders, a rare combination of circumstances
prevailed to keep it from becoming generally known
until the time had arrived when the government could
effectually reserve it from settlement. Finally, since
its formal erection into a public park, the same good
fortune has attended it, in spite of many adverse influences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
until it has become thoroughly intrenched in
the good opinion of the people.</p>

<p>So fully has the experience of the past quarter century
confirmed the wisdom of setting apart this region
for public uses, that it ought no longer to be necessary
to say a word in favor of its continued preservation.
To most people it will seem impossible that there
should be any one who would seek the mutilation or
destruction of this important reservation. Unfortunately
there are many such. No session of Congress
for twenty years has been free from attempted legislation
hostile to the Park. The schemes to convert it
into an instrument of private greed have been many,
and strange as it may seem, they are invariably put
forward by those very communities to whom the Park
is, and must ever remain, the chief glory of their section.
It is a lamentable proof of the dearth of patriotic
spirit that always betrays itself whenever the interests
of individuals and of the public come into
collision. Nevertheless it is a great satisfaction to
know that this spirit of hostility is confined to an infinitesimal
portion of the whole people. Excepting a
few mine owners and their following, a handful of
poachers, one or two railroad corporations, and a few
greedy applicants for special franchises, the people of
the country are a unit in favor of the strictest preservation
of this great national pleasure ground. No
better proof of this can be had than the fact that the
Park has successfully withstood for so long a period
every attack that has been made upon it.</p>

<p>It will not do, however, to assume that, because
these schemes have hitherto failed, they will always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
continue to fail. Since they have their origin in speculative
ventures, they will be put forward so long as
they offer the least pecuniary inducement. The certainty
of this, and the danger of their ultimate success,
justify the assignment of a brief space to a consideration
of this subject.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PT_III_CHAPTER_II" id="PT_III_CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="caption2">RAILROAD ENCROACHMENT AND CHANGE OF BOUNDARY.</p>


<p>Nearly all of the enterprises that have been put
forward in opposition to the true interests of the
Reservation partake of the nature of railroad encroachment.
Without entering into the merits of
particular projects, it will be sufficient to explain in
general terms the reasons why the government has
always opposed them.</p>

<p>Railroads in the Yellowstone Park are objectionable
because:</p>

<p>(1.) They will mar, and in places destroy, that natural
condition which is one of its greatest charms.
From the first it has been the wish of those who know
any thing of the Yellowstone that it should remain
as nature made it. The instructions of the Interior
Department to the first Superintendent of the Park,
two months after the Act of Dedication became a
law, thus announced the policy of the government
upon this subject:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the desire of the Department that any
attempts shall be made to beautify or adorn this
reservation, but merely to preserve from injury or
spoliation the timber, mineral deposits, and various
curiosities of that region, so far as possible, in their
natural condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It requires no argument to show that nothing would
so interfere with this natural condition as the construction
of a railroad through that country; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
danger involved in these projects early became apparent
to all who were well acquainted with the
situation. As early as 1883, Lieutenant Kingman
thus refers to this subject in his annual report,
wherein he describes his proposed road system for
the Park:</p>

<p>"The plan for improvement which I have submitted
is given in the earnest hope and upon the supposition
that it [the Park] will be preserved as nearly as
may be as the hand of nature left it&mdash;a source of
pleasure to all who visit it, and a source of wealth to
no one. If the Park ever becomes truly popular
and national, it will be when the people come to
know and appreciate its delightful summer climate,
the wonderful efficiency of its baths and its mineral
waters, as well as the natural wonders, beauties and
curiosities to be seen there. Then, if there are numerous
small, quiet hotels scattered here and there
throughout the Park, where visitors can have plain
and simple accommodations at moderate prices, the
overworked and the sick, as well as the curious, will
come here, not to be awed by the great falls and astounded
by the geysers, and then to go away, but will
come here and will remain for weeks and months,
and will find what they seek, rest, recreation and
health. But if it ever becomes the resort of fashion,
if its forests are stripped to rear mammoth hotels, if
the race-course, the drinking saloon and gambling-table
invade it, if its valleys are scarred by railroads, and
its hills pierced by tunnels, if its purity and quiet are
destroyed and broken by the noise and smoke of
the locomotive; &#8230; then it will cease to belong
to the whole people, and will interest only those that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
it helps to enrich, and will be unworthy the care and
protection of the National Government."</p>

<p>The history of the twelve years since the above was
written confirms in every point this forcible presentation
of the case.</p>

<p>(2.) Railroads will unavoidably seriously cripple
the present tourist routes. They must of necessity
occupy the valleys. But it is through these that the
tourist route passes, and it is frequently the case that
they are not wide enough for both. In many cases
the roadway would be forced back upon the hills,
and in others its present location would have to be
changed. It is certain that the admirable system of
roads, which the government is slowly working out,
would receive irreparable injury at the hands of any
railroad which might be built through that region.</p>

<p>(3.) Railroads would mean the inevitable destruction
of the large game. The winter snows are too
deep among the hills for game to subsist there. It is
necessary to come down into the valleys, where there is
more grass and less snow. But, as already stated, it
is through these valleys that railroads must pass if at
all. The trains would frighten the animals back into
the hills, where starvation would await them. Moreover,
the loss of game from poaching would be greatly
aggravated by the increased facility of clandestine access
to that region.</p>

<p>(4.) Railroads would destroy the Park forests. During
July, August, and September, there are always
long periods of dry weather when the dense bodies of
fallen timber, the impenetrable tangles of underbrush,
and the luxuriant prairie grass are a mass of inflammable
tinder. A spark converts it into a conflagration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
A railroad winding its way through this country
would render protection against fires, even now a
matter of great difficulty, wholly out of the question.
Referring to this subject in his annual report for 1894,
the Superintendent of the Park says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six months from the entrance of the first locomotive
within the limits of the Park, there will not be
one acre of its magnificent forests left unburned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What such a catastrophe would mean to the future
development of the surrounding country may be appreciated
by a perusal of our chapter on the Flora of
the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>(5.) As a matter of public policy, the granting of a
railway franchise in the Park is objectionable because
it necessarily creates a perpetual monopoly of a public
privilege. There is no practicable way to avoid it.
It has been proposed to compel the railroad to share
the advantage of this monopoly with the public, by
paying a certain percentage of earnings on its Park
business to constitute an improvement fund. With
Union Pacific history fresh in the public mind, the
government will not be likely to enter into a partnership
of that precarious nature.</p>

<p>From the foregoing exposition, it is clear that only
the most cogent reasons should ever sanction the construction
of railroads in the Yellowstone Park. These
reasons, from the standpoint of the railroad companies,
as set forth by the promoters of a recent bill
before Congress, fall under two heads.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is speciously urged that a railroad
would render the Park more accessible, cheapen
the cost of visiting it, and make it fulfill more perfectly
its original design as a park for the people. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
all this it may be replied that the people do not want
the improvement at the price they must pay for it.
By an almost unanimous voice they oppose it. It is
true that the Park is not as accessible as one might
wish it to be, or as it soon will be. But to make it
easily accessible, it is by no means necessary that a
railroad should pass through it. A line touching the
southern boundary and communicating with the central
portions of the country would answer every practical
purpose. The pretext that a railroad across the
Reservation will greatly aid the tourist is erroneous.
The points of interest are so scattered about that a
coach would be in any case a necessity, and all the
railroad would really save to the tourist would be the
distance from the boundary to the belt line.</p>

<p>Neither will such a railroad materially lessen the
cost of a visit, which has always been, and will always
be, in the main, getting <i>to</i> that region. The Reservation
is 1,500 miles from the center of population of
the country, and it is this remote location that makes
visiting it cost. The outlay after getting there is
trifling in comparison with that of coming and going.
Whether a railroad pass though the Park, or simply
touch its southern border, will not appreciably affect
this principal item.</p>

<p>In the second place, it is urged that the Park stands
directly in the path of the railroads and so &ldquo;acts as a
blockade to the development of three large states.&rdquo;
As this will always form the staple argument for
granting a right-of-way for railroads across the Reservation,
it will be well to scrutinize it somewhat carefully.</p>

<p>It is not at all a question of whether the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
about the Park is at present sufficiently supplied with
railroads. The important question is: Will any
portion of this territory be better served by a railroad
that may be built across the Reservation than
by one coming from another direction? The most
superficial examination of the map, even by one not
personally acquainted with the country, will answer
this question in the negative. The Yellowstone Valley
on the north, the Bighorn Valley on the east, the
Jackson Lake country on the south, and the Madison
and Henry Fork Valleys on the west, find their natural
outlets by routes not passing through the Yellowstone
Park. A railroad entering the Park on one
side through a lofty wall of mountains, and leaving it
on the other through a similar wall, after traversing
the inclosed plateau for a distance of perhaps seventy-five
or one hundred miles, would be almost as much
lost to the country outside as if for this whole distance
it were built through a tunnel. In fact, the true welfare
both of the Park and of the surrounding country
would be best served by a line passing through the
Wind River Valley, across one of the easy passes into
the Valley of the Snake, and thence along the southern
border of the Park, past Jackson Lake and the
northern spur of the Teton Range, into the valleys of
Idaho and Montana. This would give the Park a
needed southern approach, and would directly serve a
vast tract of territory. Tributary either to this line,
or to one north of the Park, or to both, another would
soon be built along the extensive Valley of the Bighorn.
No imaginable route across the National Park
could so well subserve both local and public interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>From an engineering point of view, the Yellowstone
Park is poor railroad country. It could be crossed,
to be sure, but not easily, and not at all except by
monopolizing portions of the tourist route. The long
winter season of nearly seven months would interpose
an almost insuperable obstacle to the successful operation
of any line which might be built. We quote
again from the report of the Park Superintendent for
the year 1894:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great amount of moisture furnished by the
lake and its numerous tributaries gives a mantle of
snow that will average fifteen feet in depth, and with
the strong winds prevailing in this mountainous country
no railroad could be kept running during the six
months of winter without being entirely inclosed in
snow sheds, which would prove destructive to the natural
beauty of the Park.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In short, it is certain that, were it not for the special
inducements which a monopoly of Park travel offers,
no railroad could afford to locate its line across that
territory.</p>

<p>Closely related to this general subject is that of building
an electric line for tourist transportation within
the Park. It is at once apparent that the objections
to such a railroad are much less formidable than to
one operated by steam locomotives. The danger of
fire is eliminated. The unsightly character of an ordinary
railway outfit is exchanged for attractive tourist
cars. The power plant, being located in cañons
and operated by water, would give no outward evidence
of its existence. There being no long trains
of cars, no smoke, no screeching of locomotives, the
game would not be much more frightened by it than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
by the stage coaches. In winter, traffic would be
suspended and the game would be undisturbed on the
ranges. The line, by its greater speed, would be a
convenience to tourists having but a short time at
their disposal, and also to those, infirm in health, who
find the long stage rides fatiguing.</p>

<p>Such are the merits of an electric railway for tourist
transportation in this country. If the people really
desired it, and if it could be built and operated by the
government, so as to exclude as far as possible all corporate
management of Park business, there would be
no serious objection to the project. Of course it
should never be permitted, as some times proposed, to
use the present wagon roads. These must not in any
event be interfered with.</p>

<p>The question then is, Do the people desire this
kind of transportation? Fortunately we can answer
this question with authority. In 1892, a vote upon it
was obtained from the tourists of that season. The
result was a majority of more than five to one against
it. In giving their votes, tourists frequently went beyond
the specific question at issue to express their
emphatic disapproval of the construction of any kind
of railroad in the Park. The whole result was a
gratifying proof of the deep-seated interest of the
people in this Reservation, and of their unalterable
wish that it remain forever free from the handiwork
of man. In fact, to almost every body in these days,
a coaching tour like that through the Yellowstone, is
a decided novelty. There is no other place in this
country, probably not in the world, where one approaching
it can be had. The people enjoy it. They
would prefer to see it developed and perfected, rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
than replaced by the noisy car, to get away from which
they have come so far.</p>

<p>In the long and fruitless struggle to secure rights-of-way
for railroads, the promoters of these projects
have resorted to various indirect methods the most
noteworthy of which is a proposal to change the
boundary line of the Park. We have elsewhere explained
how this boundary was originally determined.
For a random line, which of necessity it largely was,
it was a most excellent one. No one would have been
dissatisfied with it were it not that it was subsequently
found to stand in the way of certain private enterprises.</p>

<p>When it became apparent that the government
would never consent to the construction of a railroad
within the Park, it was sought to compass the same
end by cutting off all that portion of the Reservation
lying outside of, and including, the proposed right-of-way.</p>

<p>In accordance with the proverbial policy of indirection
which characterizes schemes of this sort, the
real purpose of this proposition is always veiled under
a beneficent guise, intended to make its promoters
appear as zealous guardians of the Park, rather than
what they really are&mdash;conspirators for its destruction.
The proposed change of boundary is ostensibly based
upon the alleged necessity of having a natural boundary&mdash;that
is, a boundary along the courses of streams.
The present line, it is urged, is unmarked and no one
knows where it is. A stream is a definite, visible line,
seen and known by every one.<a name="FNanchor_BV_74" id="FNanchor_BV_74"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BV_74" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BV_74" id="Footnote_BV_74"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BV_74"><span class="label">[BV]</span></a> It
is of course unnecessary to point out that an artificial line
can easily be marked so that there shall be no uncertainty about
its location. The hollowness of purpose on the part of those who
propose this argument is disclosed by the fact that, of the 280
miles, more or less, in the proposed boundary, they provide a natural
line for only about 50 miles&mdash;or along that precise portion
where they want to build a railroad. All the rest of the way an
artificial line is good enough!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The pernicious fallacy that lurks in this argument is
plainly visible if we look a little beneath the surface.
<i>Never permit the boundaries of the Yellowstone Park
to be brought down into the valleys.</i> Nature has indeed
built the proper boundaries; but they are mountain
ranges, not valleys. A thousand Chinese walls heaped
together would not form a barrier like the Absarokas
on the east, the Snowy Range on the north, the Gallatin
Range on the west, and the Tetons and the Big
Game Ridge on the south. Along the present boundary
line there are very few places where it is possible
to build human habitations. No poacher or law
breaker can there fix his stealthy abode ready at a
favorable opportunity to dash across it. But if it were
in the bottom of the valleys, a whole colony of these
dangerous individuals would soon infest every border
of the Park. Police surveillance, in any case extremely
difficult, would then be well-nigh impossible.
No! Whatever changes may be made in the boundary
of the Park, let it always be kept among the
mountain tops.</p>

<p>What the success of any of these projects to cut off,
or segregate, portions of the Park would mean, may be
judged from a single instance&mdash;that, namely, of the
north-east corner of the Park. In this strip of territory
are some of the finest scenery and most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
scientific curiosities to be found upon the Reservation.
It is the great winter grazing ground for the
elk, and by estimate based upon actual count no fewer
than 20,000 of these noble animals find their winter
subsistence here. That all of this game would be almost
instantly annihilated by the segregation of this
strip goes without saying. More than this, the admission
to the very heart of the Park of that class
of reckless characters, who even now are its greatest
source of danger, would vastly enhance the difficulty
of protecting the remaining portions.</p>

<p>It is well to emphasize by repetition the few important
facts pertaining to this question:</p>

<p>(1.) There are no private interests on the borders
of the Park whose development is jeopardized by the
refusal of the government to give access to them by
a railroad across the Reservation. They can all be
reached from the outside without encountering greater
obstacles than have been overcome in scores of other
places throughout the West.</p>

<p>(2.) There is no need of a railroad in the Park so
far as the comfort or advantage of the tourists is concerned.
A line along the southern border would answer
quite as well, and would serve the surrounding
country better.</p>

<p>(3.) There is no occasion to construct an electric
line in the Park. Nearly all of those who visit that
region oppose it.</p>

<p>(4.) There is no necessity for changing the present
boundaries of the Reservation.</p>

<p class="caption2">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>It is in respect of the foregoing matters that the
Yellowstone National Park has most to fear. The
general public, although always in favor of its preservation,
knows nothing of the merit of these various
projects. A bill is introduced in Congress in the interest
of some private enterprise. It is supported by
representations and statistics gotten up for the occasion.
There may be no one at hand to refute them,
and they are the only information upon which Congress
can act. More than once these bills have been
reported favorably from committee, when every essential
statement in the committee&rsquo;s report was contrary
to fact. Unless some friend of the Park is present,
ready and willing to devote time, and perhaps money,
to its defense, there is only too much danger that
these measures will eventually prove successful.</p>

<p>Thus far, the Park has never been lacking in such
friends; and there is no more encouraging fact in its
history than this, that some one has always been on
guard against any thing which might work to its injury.
Men like Senator Vest in official position, or
William Hallett Phillips in private life, and journals
like <i>Forest and Stream</i>, have stood for years, in a
purely public-spirited manner, without remunerative
inducement of any sort, and often in face of the bitterest
vituperation and abuse, against the designs of
selfish and unscrupulous schemers. In like manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
government officials connected with the Park have
always, with one or two exceptions, earnestly opposed
these dangerous projects. It is plain to any one who
is familiar with its inside history, that, but for the
agencies just mentioned, there would not be to-day
any Yellowstone Park at all. It is equally plain, that
so long as friends like these are forthcoming, the Park
has little to fear from its enemies.</p>

<p>In still another respect, the Park has been unfortunate
where it had a right to expect better things.
Prior to the admission of Montana, Wyoming, and
Idaho into the Union of States, its interests were
looked after in Congress, particularly in the Senate,
by a few members who took great pride in promoting
its welfare. But when the above territories were
admitted to the Union, these gentlemen very naturally
turned over the charge, which they had voluntarily
assumed, to the members from the new States,
as being thereafter its proper guardians. It was, of
course, believed that in them, if in any one, the Park
would find needed championship and protection. It
is a matter of great regret that these very reasonable
expectations have not been realized. A glance at the
list of bills pertaining to the Yellowstone National
Park, which have been presented to Congress in the
past six years, will show that nearly every objectionable
measure has been fathered by the very men
whose first duty would seem to have been to oppose
them. In a speech opposing the Segregation Project,
delivered in the Senate in the winter of 1892-3, Senator
Vest referred to this subject with justifiable indignation.
He said:</p>

<p>"When those States [Montana, Wyoming, and
Idaho] were territories, and not represented in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Senate, I considered it the duty of every Senator, as
this Park belonged to all the people of the United
States, &#8230; to defend its integrity, and to keep
it for the purposes for which it was originally designed.
Since Senators have come from those States,
who, of course, must be supposed to know more
about that Park than those of us who live at a distance,
and since they have manifested a disposition to
mutilate it, I must confess that my interest in it has
rather flagged, and I feel very much disposed, in plain
language, to wash my hands of the whole business.
If the constituencies, who are more benefited than
any others can possibly be in the Park, are willing to
see it cut off, the best disposition of the matter would
be to turn it open to the public, let the full greed and
avarice of the country have their scope, let the geysers
be divided out and taken for the purpose of washing
clothes, &#8230; let the water of that splendid water-fall
in the Yellowstone River be used to turn machinery,
let the timber be cut off; in other words, destroy
the Park, and make it a sacrifice to the greed of this
advanced age in which we live."</p>

<p>It is only fair to say that generally these members
do not personally favor the measures to which they
lend official countenance and comfort. One can find
a practical, if not a morally justifiable, excuse for their
course in the exigencies of political life which too often
constrain men to official action not in accordance with
their private judgment. Unquestionably, a majority
of the people of these young and enterprising states
are immovably opposed to any thing which may tend
to mutilate or destroy this important reservation; and
it is not believed that their broader patriotism will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
ever be overridden by the narrow and perverted wishes
of a few straggling constituencies.<a name="FNanchor_BW_75" id="FNanchor_BW_75"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BW_75" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BW_75" id="Footnote_BW_75"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_BW_75"><span class="label">[BW]</span></a> The
almost prophetic warning of Captain Harris in his last
report as Superintendent of the Park has a peculiar force in this
connection:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my experience in connection with this National Park, I
have been very forcibly impressed with the danger to which it is
subjected by the greed of private enterprise. All local influence
centers in schemes whereby the Park can be used for pecuniary
advantage. In the unsurpassed grandeur of its natural condition,
it is the pride and glory of the nation; but if, under the guise of
improvement, selfish interests are permitted to make merchandise
of its wonders and beauties, it will inevitably become a by-word
and a reproach.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, the effect of a single evil precedent upon
the future of the Park must be kept constantly in
mind. The door once opened, though by never so
small a degree, can not again be closed; but will
sooner or later be thrown wide open. A privilege
granted to one can not be denied to another. If one
corner of the Park is cut off, other portions will share
the same fate. If one railroad is granted a right of
way across the reservation, another can not be refused.
The only way to avoid these dangers is to keep the
door entirely closed.</p>

<p>There is now but little real need of further positive
legislation. Some provision should of course be made
for an adequate police force, and ample means should
be provided to perfect the system of roads. Happily
this duty involves no appreciable burden. It requires
no continuing outlay to &ldquo;beautify and adorn.&rdquo; And
when it is done, the further policy of the government
toward the Park should be strictly negative, designed
solely to preserve it unimpaired, as its founders intended,
for the &ldquo;benefit and enjoyment&rdquo; of succeeding
generations.</p>

<p class="caption3">INTRODUCTORY.</p>

<p>In common experience, the importance of geographical
names lies in their use as a means of identification. To describe
an object there must be a name, and for this purpose
one name is as good as another. But if the reason be sought
why a particular name happened to be selected, it will generally
be found to arise, not from this practical necessity, but
from some primary fact or tradition, or from some distinguished
character, in the annals of the community where it
occurs. In its mountains and valleys, its lakes and streams,
and in its civil divisions, the cradle history of a country may
always be found recorded.</p>

<p>In newly-discovered countries, the naming of geographical
features is the dearest prerogative of the explorer, as it is also
the one most liable to abuse from personal vanity or egotism.
The desire to attach his name, or those of his personal friends,
to the prominent landmarks of the globe, where the eye of
posterity may never escape them, is a weakness from which
no discoverer has yet shown himself free.</p>

<p>In a region like the Yellowstone National Park, destined
for all time to be a resort for the lovers of science and pleasure,
this temptation was quite irresistible; so much so, that,
when the expeditions of 1870 and 1871 left the field, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
left little worth naming behind them. And yet the honor
thus gained has not, we venture to say, been all that its votaries
desired. Small is the number of tourists who stop to inquire
for whom Mary Lake, DeLacy Creek, or Stevenson
Island was named. Fewer still are aware that Mt. Everts
was <i>not</i> christened in honor of a distinguished American
statesman of similar name, but in commemoration of one of
the most thrilling individual experiences in American history.
So with all these personal names. The lively satisfaction
with which they were given finds no counterpart in the languid
indifference with which the modern visitor mechanically
repeats them.</p>

<p>In as much as it fell to the lot of the United States Geological
Survey to originate a great many of the names in our
western geography, it is interesting to know from official
sources the principles which governed in this important work.
Writing upon this point, Dr. Hayden says:<a name="FNanchor_BX_76" id="FNanchor_BX_76"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BX_76" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;In attaching names to the many mountain peaks, new
streams, and other geographical localities, the discovery of
which falls to the pleasant lot of the explorer in the untrodden
wilds of the West, I have followed the rigid law of priority,
and given the one by which they have been generally
known among the people of the country, whether whites or
Indians; but if, as is often the case, no suitable descriptive
name can be secured from the surroundings, a personal one
may then be attached, and the names of eminent men who
have identified themselves with the great cause, either in the
fields of science or legislation, naturally rise first in the
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the more recent and thorough survey of the Park by the
United States Geological Survey, it became necessary to provide
names for those subordinate features which, in a less restricted
field, the early explorers had thought unworthy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
notice. Professor Arnold Hague, upon whom this work has
principally fallen, thus states the rule which he has
followed:<a name="FNanchor_BY_77" id="FNanchor_BY_77"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BY_77" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;In consultation with Mr. Henry Gannett, geologist in
charge of geography, it was agreed that the necessary new
names to designate the unnamed mountains, valleys, and
streams should be mainly selected from the beasts, birds,
fishes, trees, flowers, and minerals found within the Park or
the adjacent country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The christening of the hot springs and geysers of the Park
has been singularly fortunate. The names are in all cases
characteristic. They are not studied efforts, but are simply
the spontaneous utterances from first impressions by those
who had never seen, and had heard but little of, similar
phenomena. It is doubtful if the most careful study could
improve them, and tourists will agree with General Poe who
referred as follows to this subject when he visited the Park in
1877:<a name="FNanchor_BZ_78" id="FNanchor_BZ_78"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_BZ_78" class="fnanchor">[BZ]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The region of these geysers has been rightly named Fire
Hole, and one almost wonders that in this country, where the
tendency is to name natural objects after men who have a
temporary prominence, this interesting place and its assemblage
of wonders should have so completely escaped, and in
general and in particular received names so very appropriate.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Inspection made in the Summer of 1877, etc.&rdquo; See <a href="#bibl_64">Appendix E</a>.</p></div>

<p>In the race for the geographical honors of the Park, the
prize fell neither to the United States Geological Survey nor
even to Colonel Norris, though each was a close competitor.
It was won by that mythical potentate of whose sulphurous
empire this region is thought by some to be simply an outlying
province. Starting with &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell,&rdquo; the list grew
until it contained &ldquo;Hell Roaring Creek,&rdquo; "Hell Broth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Springs," &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Half Acre,&rdquo; &ldquo;Satan&rsquo;s Arbor,&rdquo; and the
Devil&rsquo;s &ldquo;Den,&rdquo; &ldquo;Workshop,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kitchen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stairway,&rdquo;

&ldquo;Elbow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thumb,&rdquo; &ldquo;Inkstand,&rdquo; etc., etc. It is some satisfaction
to know that this rude and fiery nomenclature is gradually
falling into disuse.</p>

<p>In a measure from sympathy with the purpose of the early
name-givers, and to help those who take an interest in such
matters to know when, by whom, and why the geographical
names of the Park were given, a complete list of these names,
with a few from adjacent territory, has been prepared. The
letters and numbers immediately after the names (except
those in parentheses) give marginal references on the map to
facilitate identification. The date of christening and the
name of the christening party next follow. When these can
not now be determined with precision, the work is credited
to the authors of the map upon which they first appear.
Next comes whatever account is discoverable of the origin of
the names, authority being quoted, as far as possible, from
the writings of whoever bestowed them. Wherever an object
was named from some natural characteristic, as its form, color,
composition, or other peculiarity, or from the birds, beasts,
fishes, insects, trees, flowers, shrubs or minerals of the Park,
the single word &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; denotes the fact. The abbreviation
&ldquo;U. S. G. S.&rdquo; is for &ldquo;United States Geological
Survey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Absaroka Range</i>, A-X: 12-16&mdash;1885&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;This range
of mountains has had an unfortunate christening history. It
was first known as the Yellowstone Range, from its close relation
to the Yellowstone River, of which it is the source.
The original name dates from as far back as 1863, and was
adopted by the first explorers of the Park country. It was
officially recognized in 1871, by both the Corps of Engineers
and the United States Geological Survey. When the Park was
created this range became its real eastern boundary, and many
of its peaks were named for those who had borne prominent
parts in its history. The name had thus an added claim to
perpetuity. It passed into general use, and appears in all the
writings of the United States Geological Survey down to 1883.</p>

<p>In 1873, Captain W. A. Jones, of the Corps of Engineers,
led an expedition through these mountains&mdash;the first that ever
crossed them. He gave them a new name, &ldquo;Sierra Shoshone.&rdquo;
Except for the fact that he was violating the rule of priority,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
his action in giving this name, as well as his judgment in its
selection, were of unquestionable propriety. It was a tribe of
the Shoshonean family who alone dwelt in the Park, or among
these mountains, and it was entirely fitting to commemorate
this fact in a distinct and permanent manner. The name
passed rapidly into public use, and by 1880 had practically
supplanted the original name.</p>

<p>For reasons that can hardly be made to appear satisfactory,
the United States Geological Survey, in 1883, or soon after,
rejected both these names and adopted in their place Absaroka,
&ldquo;the Indian name of the Crow nation&rdquo; (Hague). Of course
this action can have no pretense of justification from the standpoint
of the &ldquo;rigid law of priority.&rdquo; There are very few instances
in American geography of a similar disregard for
the rights of previous explorers. Unfortunately, not even the
argument of appropriateness can be urged in its defense.
These mountains, except that portion north of the Park, were
never properly Crow territory, and the name is thus distinctly
an importation. Its future use is now unhappily assured, on
account of its formal adoption (for reasons wholly inadequate,
it is true,) by the United States Board on Geographical
Names. Against the influence of the government, with its
extensive series of publications, even though committed to
the perpetuation of an error, it is idle to contend; but it is
greatly to be deplored that a feature of the Park scenery of
such commanding prominence should not bear a name at least

<p><a name="Bannock_Peak" id="Bannock_Peak"></a><i>Bannock Peak</i> (10,400)&mdash;D: 4&mdash;1885&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;From
the name of a tribe of Indians who inhabited the country to
the south-west of the Park, and were finally settled on a reservation
in southern Idaho. What is known as the Great
Bannock Trail, passed along the valley of Indian Creek, some
distance south of this mountain. The spelling here given is
that which custom seems finally to have settled upon; but
Bannack would more nearly express the original pronunciation.
The various spellings, some
sixteen in number, come from the
original <i>Panai&rsquo;hti</i>, or <i>Bannai&rsquo;hti</i>,
meaning southern people.</p>

<p><i>Barlow Peak</i> (9,500)&mdash;Q: 10&mdash;1895&mdash;U.

(now Colonel) J. W. Barlow, Corps
of Engineers, U. S. A., leader of the
military expedition which entered
the Park region in 1871. His name
was first applied to the upper course
of the Snake River, but was recently
transferred to a neighboring
mountain peak.</p>

<p><i>Baronett Peak</i> (10,300)&mdash;C: 13&mdash;1878&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;For
C. J. Baronett, &ldquo;Yellowstone Jack,&rdquo; a famous scout and
guide, closely connected with the history of the National
Park, and builder of the first bridge across the Yellowstone
River.</p>

<p>Baronett&rsquo;s career was adventurous beyond the average man
of his class. He was born in Glencoe, Scotland, in 1829.
His father was in the British naval service, and he early began
to follow the sea. In his multitudinous wanderings we
find him on the coast of Mexico during the Mexican War;
on the Chinese coast in 1850, where he deserted his ship and
fled to San Francisco; in 1852, in Australia after gold; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
next year in Africa, still on a gold hunt; then in Australia
again and in San Francisco; next in the Arctic seas as
second mate on a whaling vessel; back in California in 1855;
courier for Albert Sidney Johnston in the Mormon War;
later in Colorado and California
searching for gold; scout in
the Confederate service until
1863; then in Mexico with the
French under Maximilian, who
made him a captain; back in
California in 1864, and in Montana
in September of the same
year, where he at once set out
on a prospecting trip which
took him entirely through the
region of the Yellowstone Park;
later in the service of Gen. Custer
as scout in the Indian territory;
then in Mexico and finally back in Montana in 1870;
finder of the lost Everts; builder of his celebrated bridge
in 1871; in the Black Hills in 1875, where he slew a
local editor who had unjustly reflected upon him in his
paper; scout in the Sioux, Nez Percé, and Bannock Wars,
1876-8; Indian trader for many years; engaged in innumerable
prospecting ventures; and still, at the age of
sixty-six, searching with his old time ardor for the elusive
yellow metal.</p>

<p class="fig_caption">CAPTAIN GUSTAVUS C. DOANE.</p>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Doane was born in Illinois, May 29, 1840, and
died in Bozeman, Mont., May 5, 1892. At the age of five
he went with his parents, in wake of an ox team, to Oregon.
In 1849 his family went to
California at the outbreak
of the gold excitement.
He remained there ten
years, in the meanwhile
working his way through
school. In 1862 he entered
the Union service,
went east with the California
Hundred, and then
joined a Massachusetts cavalry
regiment. He was
mustered out in 1865 as a
First Lieutenant. He joined
the Carpet-baggers and
is said to have become mayor of Yazoo City, Mississippi.
He was appointed a Second Lieutenant in the Regular Army
in 1868, and continued in the service until his death, attaining
the rank of Captain.</p>

<p>Doane&rsquo;s whole career was actuated by a love of adventure.
He had at various times planned a voyage to the Polar regions,
or an expedition of discovery into Africa. But fate
assigned him a middle ground, and he became prominently
connected with the discovery of the Upper Yellowstone country.
His part in the Expedition of 1870 is second to none.
He made the first official report upon the wonders of the
Yellowstone, and his fine descriptions have never been surpassed
by any subsequent writer. Although suffering intense
physical torture during the greater portion of the trip, it did
not extinguish in him the truly poetic ardor with which those
strange phenomena seem to have inspired him. Dr. Hayden
says of this report: "I venture to state, as my opinion, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
for graphic description and thrilling interest it has not been
surpassed by any official report made to our government since

<p>Lieutenant Doane and Mr. Langford were the first white
men known to have ascended any of the higher peaks of the
Absaroka Range. From the summit of the mountain so ascended,
Mr. Langford made the first known authentic sketch
of Yellowstone Lake. This sketch was used soon after by
General Washburn in compiling an official map of that section
of country, and he was so much pleased with it that he
named the mountain from which it was taken, Mt. Langford.
At Mr. Langford&rsquo;s request, he named a neighboring peak,
Mt. Doane.</p>

<p>Dunraven visited the Park in 1874. In 1876, he published
his &ldquo;Great Divide,&rdquo; describing his travels in the West. The
irrepressible Colonel Norris named this peak after himself,
and coupled it with Mt. Washburn in a characteristic poem.
But the United States Geological Survey decided otherwise,
and transferred the colonel&rsquo;s name to the north-east corner
of the Park. (See "<a href="#Norris_Mt">Mt. Norris</a>.")</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thunder-shower was approaching as we neared the summit
of the mountain. I was above the others of the party,
and, when about fifty feet below the summit, the electric current
began to pass through my body. At first I felt nothing,
but heard a crackling noise, similar to a rapid discharge
of sparks from a friction machine. Immediately after, I
began to feel a tingling or pricking sensation in my head and
the ends of my fingers, which, as well as the noise, increased
rapidly, until, when I reached the top, the noise, which had
not changed its character, was deafening, and my hair stood
completely on end, while the tingling, pricking sensation was
absolutely painful. Taking off my hat partially relieved it.
I started down again, and met the others twenty-five or thirty
feet below the summit. They were affected similarly, but in
a less degree. One of them attempted to go to the top, but
had proceeded but a few feet when he received quite a severe
shock, which felled him as if he had stumbled. We then returned
down the mountain about three hundred feet, and to this
point we still heard and felt the electricity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This name, as now applied, refers to a different feature from
that originally designated by it. Many years before the Park
was discovered, it was used to denote the long ridge of which
Mt. Washburn is the commanding summit, and which was
distinctly visible from beyond the present limits of the Park,
both north and south. It so appears upon Raynolds' map of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
1860, and was so used by the Washburn Expedition (1870),
by Captain Barlow (1871), and by Captain Jones (1873).
The United States Geological Survey, however, in 1871,
transferred the name to an inconspicuous ridge more than
a thousand feet lower than the surrounding mountains.
Whether the change was made by accident or design does
not appear. Captain Ludlow, as late as 1875, refers to it
and deplores the fact that it had taken place.</p>

<p><i>Everts, Mt.</i> (7,900)&mdash;C: 7&mdash;1870&mdash;Washburn Party.&mdash;For
Hon. Truman C. Everts, member of the Expedition of 1870,
whose terrible experience is elsewhere alluded to. The following
succinct account is from the pen of Lieutenant Doane,
and is in the main correct:<a name="FNanchor_CF_84" id="FNanchor_CF_84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CF_84" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a></p>

<p>"On the first day of his absence, he had left his horse standing
unfastened, with all his arms and equipments strapped
upon his saddle; the animal became frightened, ran away into
the woods, and he was left without even a pocket knife as a
means of defense. Being very near-sighted, and totally unused
to traveling in a wild country without guides, he became
completely bewildered. He wandered down to the Snake
River Lake [Hart Lake], where he remained twelve days,
sleeping near the hot springs to keep from freezing at night,
and climbing to the summits each day in the endeavor to
trace out his proper course. Here he subsisted on thistle-roots,
boiled in the springs, and was kept up a tree the greater
part of one night by a California lion. After gathering and
cooking a supply of thistle-roots, he managed to strike the
south-west point of the [Yellowstone] Lake, and followed
around the north side to the Yellowstone [River], finally
reaching our [old] camp opposite the Grand Cañon. He was
twelve days out before he thought to kindle a fire by using
the lenses of his field-glass, but afterward carried a burning
brand with him in all his wanderings. Herds of game
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
passed by him during the night, on many occasions when he
was on the verge of starvation. In addition to a tolerable
supply of thistle-roots, he had nothing for over thirty days
but a handful of minnows and a couple of snow-birds. Twice
he went five days without food, and three days without water,
in that country which is a net-work of streams and springs.
He was found on the verge of the great plateau, above the
mouth of Gardiner&rsquo;s River. A heavy snow-storm had extinguished
his fire; his supply of thistle-roots was exhausted;
he was partially deranged, and perishing with cold. A large
lion was killed near him, on the trail, which he said had followed
him at a short distance for several days previously. It
was a miraculous escape, considering the utter helplessness of
the man, lost in a forest wilderness, and with the storms of
winter at hand."</p>

<p>On the thirty-seventh day of his wanderings (September
9th to October 16th), he was discovered by Jack Baronett
and George A. Pritchett, near the great trail on a high mountain
a few miles west of Yancey&rsquo;s. Baronett threw up a
mound of stones to mark the spot. He carried Everts in his
arms the rest of that day, and passed the night on a small
tributary of Black-tail Deer Creek. The next day he was
taken on a saddle to near the mouth of the Gardiner.</p>

<p>The commemoration of this adventure in the naming of Mt.
Everts was an awkward mischance. The mountain which
should bear the name is Mt. Sheridan. It was named for Everts
by the Washburn Party the night before he was lost, in recognition
of his having been the first white man (except Mr.
Hedges, who was with him) known to have visited its summit.
In the writings of the Washburn Party after their return, it
is so used; one very interesting article, by Mr. Hedges, with
this name as a title, being published in the <i>Helena Herald</i> before
it was known that Mr. Everts had been found. But the
name, Mt. Everts, was finally given to the broad plateau between
the Gardiner and the Yellowstone, a feature which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
not a mountain at all, and which is ten miles from where
Everts was found. The actual locality of the finding was
erroneously supposed to be near &ldquo;Rescue Creek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1871, Captain Barlow ascended the mountain which
should have borne the name of Everts, and called it Mt.
Sheridan, in ignorance of its former christening.</p>

<p><i>Factory Hill</i> (9,500)&mdash;O: 8&mdash;1885&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;The term
&ldquo;factory&rdquo; has at various times been applied to several different
localities in the Park, because of their striking resemblance
on frosty mornings to an active factory town. The resemblance
was noted as far back as 1829. The name has
now become fixed, as above indicated.</p>

<p>Mr. Langford was born August 9, 1832, in Westmoreland,
Oneida County, New York. His early life was spent on his
father&rsquo;s farm, and his education was obtained by winter attendance
at district school. At nineteen, he became clerk in
the Oneida Bank of Utica. In 1854, he went to St. Paul,
where we find him, in 1855, cashier of the banking house of
Marshall &amp; Co., and in 1858, cashier of the Bank of the State
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of Minnesota. In 1862, he went to Montana as second in
command of the Northern Overland Expedition, consisting of
130 men and 53 wagons drawn by oxen. In 1864, he was
made Collector of Internal
Revenue for the new territory.
In 1868, he was appointed
by President Johnson
Governor of Montana,
but as this was after the
Senate&rsquo;s imbroglio with the
President and its refusal
to confirm any more presidential
appointments, he
did not reach this office.
He was one of the famous
Montana Vigilantes, a
member of the Yellowstone
Expedition of 1870, and
first Superintendent of the
newly created Park. In
1872, he was appointed National Bank Examiner for the
Pacific States and Territories, and held the office for thirteen
years. He now resides in St. Paul, Minnesota. He
is author of a series of articles in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s</i> for 1871, describing
the newly-discovered wonders of the Yellowstone,
and of the important work, &ldquo;Vigilante Days and Ways,&rdquo;
the most complete history in existence of that critical period
in Montana history.</p>

<p>The notable part which Mr. Langford bore in the discovery
of the Upper Yellowstone country, and in the creation of the
Yellowstone National Park, has been fully set forth elsewhere.
He has always been its ardent friend, and his enthusiasm upon
the subject in the earlier days of its history drew upon him
the mild raillery of his friends, who were wont to call him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
&ldquo;National Park&rdquo; Langford&mdash;a soubriquet to which the initials

<p><a name="Norris_Mt" id="Norris_Mt"></a><i>Norris, Mt.</i> (9,900)&mdash;E:
13&mdash;1878&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;For
Philetus W. Norris,
second Superintendent of
the Park, and the most
conspicuous figure in its
history.</p>

<p>He was born at Palmyra,
New York, August 17,
1821. At the age of eight,
he was tourist guide at
Portage Falls on the Genesee
River, New York, and
at seventeen he was in
Manitoba in the service of British fur traders. In 1842, he
settled in Williams County, Ohio, where he founded the village
of Pioneer. Between 1850 and 1860 he visited the Far West.
At the outbreak of the Civil War, he entered the army and
served a short time as spy and captain of scouts. He was
then placed in charge of Rebel prisoners on Johnson&rsquo;s Island.
He next entered politics as member of the Ohio House
of Representatives, but being later defeated for the State
Senate, he joined the United States Sanitary Commission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and went again to the front. He soon returned and became
trustee of certain landed property near the City of
Detroit belonging to officers and soldiers of both armies.
These lands he reclaimed at great expense from their original
swampy condition, and built thereon the village of Norris, now
part of Detroit. In 1770, he went west again and undertook
to enter the Park region in June of that year, but permitted
the swollen condition of the streams to defeat his project.
He thus missed the honor which a few months later fell to the
Washburn Party&mdash;a misfortune which he never ceased to deplore.
In 1875, he again visited the Park, and in 1877, became
its second Superintendent. In 1882, he returned to
Detroit, after which he was employed by the government to
explore old Indian mounds, forts, villages, and tombs, and to
collect relics for the National Museum. He died at Rocky
Hill, Kentucky, January 14, 1885. He is author of the following
works: Five Annual Reports as Superintendent of
the Park; &ldquo;The Calumet of the Coteau,&rdquo; a volume of verse,
with much additional matter relating to the Park; and a long
series of articles on &ldquo;The Great West,&rdquo; published in the <i>Norris
Suburban</i> in 1876-8.</p>

<p>The above sketch sufficiently discloses the salient characteristic
of Norris' career. His life was that of the pioneer,
and was spent in dealing first blows in the subjugation of a
primeval wilderness. He was &ldquo;blazing trails,&rdquo; literally and
figuratively, all his days, leaving to others the building of the
finished highway. It is therefore not surprising that his work
lacks the element of completeness, which comes only from
patient attention to details. Nowhere is this defect more apparent
than in his writings. A distinct literary talent, and
something of the poet&rsquo;s inspiration, were, to use his own
words, &ldquo;well nigh strangled&rdquo; by the &ldquo;stern realities of border
life.&rdquo; His prose abounds in aggregations of more than
one hundred words between periods, so ill arranged and barbarously
punctuated as utterly to bewilder the reader. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
verse&mdash;we have searched in vain for a single quatrain that
would justify reproduction. Nevertheless, his writings, like
his works, were always to some good purpose. They contained
much useful information, and, being widely read throughout
the West, had a large and beneficial influence.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better or more generous estimate of his character
can be found than in the following words of Mr. Langford
who knew him well: &ldquo;He was a good man, a true man,
faithful to his friends, of very kind heart, grateful for kindnesses,
of more than ordinary personal courage, rather vain
of his poetical genius, and fond of perpetuating his name in
prominent features of scenery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concerning which last characteristic it may be noted that three
mountain peaks, one geyser basin, one pass, and an uncertain
number of other features of the Park, were thought by Colonel
Norris deserving of this distinction. With inimitable
fidelity to this trait of his character, he had even selected as
his final resting-place the beautiful open glade on the south
side of the Grand Cañon, just below the Lower Falls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why this mountain received such a melancholy appellation
I have not been able to discover. So far as I know, the
most important thing buried beneath its dark mass is the secret
of its structure. It is possible that the form suggested
the name.&rdquo;</p>

It was upon one of the &ldquo;ancient and but recently
deserted, secluded, unknown haunts&rdquo; of these Indians, that
Colonel Norris, &ldquo;in rapt astonishment,&rdquo; stumbled one day, and
was so impressed by what he saw, that he gave the neighboring
cliff its present name. He thus describes this retreat:<a name="FNanchor_CI_87" id="FNanchor_CI_87"></a>

<p>&ldquo;It is mainly carpeted with soft grass, dotted, fringed, and
overhung with small pines, firs and cedars, and, with the subdued
and mingled murmur of the rapids and cataracts above

is truly an enchanting dell&mdash;a wind and storm sheltered refuge
for the feeble remnant of a fading race.&rdquo;</p>

Fifth Annual Report of Dr. Hayden.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Stevenson was born in Maysville, Ky., December 24,
1840. He early displayed a taste for exploration and natural
history, and such reading as his limited education permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
was devoted to books treating of these subjects. At the age
of thirteen he ran away from home and joined a party of
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Fur Company&rsquo;s traders, bound up the Missouri
River. On the same boat
was Dr. F. V. Hayden,
then on his way to explore
the fossiliferous region of
the Upper Missouri and
Yellowstone Rivers. Noticing
Stevenson&rsquo;s taste for
natural history he invited
him to join him in his
work. Stevenson accepted;
and thus began a relation
which lasted for
more than a quarter of a
century, and which gave
direction to the rest of his
life.</p>

<img src="images/pg308.png" width="351" height="377" alt="" />
<p class="fig_caption">JAMES STEVENSON.</p>
</div>

<p>He was engaged in several explorations between 1850 and
1860, connected with the Pacific railroad surveys, and with
others under Lieutenants G. K. Warren and W. F. Raynolds.
In 1861 he entered the Union service as a private
soldier, and left it in 1865 with an officer&rsquo;s commission.
After the war he resumed his connection with Dr. Hayden.
He was mainly instrumental in the organization of the
United States Geological Survey of the Territories in 1867,
and during the next twelve years he was constantly engaged in
promoting its welfare. When the consolidation of the various
geographical and geological surveys took place in 1879, under
the name of the United States Geological Survey, he became
associated with the United States Bureau of Ethnology. He
had always shown a taste for ethnological investigations and
his scientific work during the rest of his life was in this direction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
principally among the races of New Mexico and Arizona.
He died in New York City July 25, 1888.</p>

<p>In the paragraph quoted above from Dr. Hayden there is
more than any but the few who are familiar with the early
history of the geological surveys will understand. It rarely
happens that a master is so far indebted to a servant for his
success, as was true of the relation of Dr. Hayden and James
Stevenson. Stevenson&rsquo;s great talent lay in the organization
and management of men. His administrative ability in the
field was invaluable to the Survey of which Hayden was
chief, and his extraordinary influence with Congressmen was
a vital element in its early growth. His part in the Yellowstone
Explorations of 1871 and 1872 is second to none in importance.
It will not be forgotten that he was the first to
build and launch a boat upon the Yellowstone Lake, nor that
he, and Mr. Langford who was with him, were the first white
men to reach the summit of the Grand Teton.</p>

<p><i>Teton, Grand</i> (13,691)&mdash;Not on Map.&mdash;This mountain has
borne its present name for upward of four score years.
Through more than half a century it was a cynosure to the
wandering trapper, miner and explorer. The name has
passed into all the literature of that period, which will ever
remain one of the most fascinating in our western history.
Indeed, it has become the classic designation of the most interesting
historic summit of the Rocky Mountains. That it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
should always retain this designation in memory of the nameless
pioneers who have been guided by it across the wilderness,
and thousands of whom have perished beneath its
shadow, would seem to be a self-evident proposition. Individual
merit, no matter how great, can never justify the usurpation
of its place by any personal name whatever. An attempt
to do this was made in 1872 by the United States
Geological Survey who rechristened it Mt. Hayden. The
new name has never gained any local standing, and although
it has crept into many maps its continued use ought to be discouraged.
It is greatly to the credit of Dr. Hayden that he
personally disapproved the change, so far at least, as very
rarely, if ever, to refer to the mountain by its new name.</p>

Expedition of 1870.</p>

<p>General Washburn was born in Windsor, Vt., March 28,
1832. His parents moved to Ohio during his infancy. He
received a common school education and at fourteen began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
teaching school. He entered Oberlin College, but did not complete
his course. At eighteen he went to Indiana where he
resumed school-teaching. At twenty-one he entered the New
York State and National
Law School, from which
he graduated. At twenty-three
he was elected auditor
of Vermilion county,
Indiana.</p>

<p>His war record was a
highly honorable one. He
entered the army as private
in 1861 and left it
as brevet brigadier-general
in 1865. His service was
mainly identified with the
Eighteenth Indiana, of
which he became colonel.
He was in several of the
western campaigns, notably
in that of Vicksburg, in which he bore a prominent part.
In the last year of the war he was with Sherman&rsquo;s army, and
for a short time after its close was in command of a military
district in southern Georgia. In 1864, he was elected to
Congress over the Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees, and again, in
1866, over the Hon. Solomon W. Claypool. At the expiration
of his second term he was appointed by President Grant,
surveyor-general of Montana, which office he held until his
death.</p>

<p class="fig_caption">GEN. HENRY DANA WASHBURN.</p>
</div>

<p>It was during his residence in Montana that the famous
Yellowstone Expedition of 1870 took place. His part in that
important work is perhaps the most notable feature of his career.
As leader of the expedition he won the admiration and
affection of its members. He was the first to send to Washington
specimens from the geyser formations. He ardently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
espoused the project of setting apart this region as a public
park and was on his way to Washington in its interest when
his career was cut short by death. The hardship and exposure
of the expedition had precipitated the catastrophe to
which he had long been tending. He left Helena in November,
1870, and died of consumption at his home in Clinton,
Indiana, January 26, 1871.</p>

<p>General Washburn&rsquo;s name was given to this mountain by a
unanimous vote of the party on the evening of August 28,
1870, as a result of the following incident related by Mr.
Langford:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our first Sunday in camp was at Tower Creek. The forest
around us was very dense, and we were somewhat at a loss
in deciding what course we needed to follow in order to reach
Yellowstone Lake. We had that day crossed a <i>fresh</i> Indian
trail, a circumstance which admonished us of the necessity of
watchfulness so as to avoid disaster. While we were resting
in camp, General Washburn, without our knowledge, and unattended,
made his way to the mountain, from the summit of
which, overlooking the dense forest which environed us, he
saw Yellowstone Lake, our objective point, and carefully noted
its direction from our camp. This intelligence was most joyfully
received by us, for it relieved our minds of all anxiety
concerning our course of travel, and dispelled the fears of
some of our party lest we should become inextricably involved
in that wooded labyrinth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Gardiner River</i> (5360)&mdash;B : 6&mdash;This name, which, after
&ldquo;Yellowstone,&rdquo; is the most familiar and important name in the
Park, is the most difficult to account for. The first authentic
use of the name occurs in 1870, in the writings of the Washburn
party. In Mr. Langford&rsquo;s journal, kept during the expedition,
is the following entry for August 25, 1870: &ldquo;At nineteen
miles from our morning camp we came to Gardiner River,
at the mouth of which we camped.&rdquo; As the party did not
originate the name, and as they make no special reference to
it in any of their writings, it seems clear that it must already
have been known to them at the time of their arrival at the
stream. None of the surviving members has the least recollection
concerning it. The stream had been known to prospectors
during the preceding few years as Warm Spring
Creek, and the many &ldquo;old timers&rdquo; consulted on the subject
erroneously think that the present name was given by the
Washburn Party or by the Hayden Party of 1871. What
is its real origin is therefore a good deal of a mystery.</p>

<p>The only clue, and that not a satisfactory one, which has
come under our observation, is to be found in the book &ldquo;River
of the West,&rdquo; already quoted. Reference is there made to a
trapper by the name of Gardiner, who lived in the Upper
Yellowstone country as far back as 1830, and was at one time
a companion of Joseph Meek, the hero of the book. In another
place it is stated that in 1838, Meek started alone from
Missouri Lake (probably Red Rock Lake) "for the Gallatin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Fork of the Missouri, trapping in a mountain basin called
Gardiner&rsquo;s Hole&#8230;. On his return, in another basin
called Burnt Hole, he found a buffalo skull, etc." As is well
known, the sources of the Gallatin and Gardiner are interlaced
with each other, and this reference strongly points to the present
Gardiner Valley as &ldquo;Gardiner&rsquo;s Hole.&rdquo; The route across
the Gallatin Range to Mammoth Hot Springs, and thence
back by way of the Firehole Basin, was doubtless a natural
one then as it is now. It is therefore reasonable to suppose
that this name came from an old hunter in the early years of
the century, and that the Washburn Party received it from
some surviving descendant of those times.</p>

<p><i>Stinkingwater River</i>&mdash;L: 16&mdash;1807&mdash;John Colter&mdash;From
an offensive hot spring near the junction of the principal forks
of the stream. A most interesting fact, to which attention
was first publicly called by Prof. Arnold Hague, is the occurrence
on the map, which Lewis and Clark sent to President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Jefferson in the spring of 1805, of the name &ldquo;Stinking Cabin
Creek,&rdquo; very nearly in the locality of the river Stinkingwater.
Prof. Hague, who published an interesting paper concerning
this map in <i>Science</i> for November 4, 1877, thinks that possibly
some trapper had penetrated this region even before
1804. But with Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s repeated statements that
no white man had reached the Yellowstone prior to 1805, it
seems more likely that the name was derived from the Indians.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Bridger Lake</i> (7,900)&mdash;R: 13&mdash;Name a fixture prior to
1870.&mdash;For James Bridger, the Daniel Boone of the Rockies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
and one of the most remarkable products of the trapping and
gold-seeking eras.</p>

<p>He was born in Richmond, Va., in March, 1804, and died
in Washington, Jackson Co., Mo., July 17, 1881. He
must have gone west at a very early age for he is known to
have been in the mountains in 1820. <i>Niles Register</i> for 1822
speaks of him as associated with Fitzpatrick in the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company. Another record of this period reveals
him as leader of a band of whites sent to retake stolen
horses from the hostile Bannocks. In 1832, he had become a
resident partner in the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.
That he was a recognized leader among the early mountaineers
while yet in his minority seems beyond question. He became
&ldquo;The Old Man of the Mountains&rdquo; before he was thirty
years of age.</p>

<p>Among the more prominent achievements of Bridger&rsquo;s life
may be noted the following: He was long a leading spirit in
the great Rocky Mountain Fur Company. He discovered
Great Salt Lake and the noted Pass that bears his name.
He built Fort Bridger in the lovely valley of Black Fork of
Green River, where transpired many thrilling events connected
with the history of the Mormons and &ldquo;Forty-niners.&rdquo;
He had explored, and could accurately describe, the wonders
of the Yellowstone fully a quarter of a century before their
final discovery.</p>

<p>In person he was tall and spare, straight and agile, eyes
gray, hair brown and long, and abundant even in old age;
expression mild, and manners agreeable. He was hospitable
and generous, and was always trusted and respected. He
possessed to a high degree the confidence of the Indians, one
of whom, a Shoshone woman, he made his wife.</p>

<p>Unquestionably Bridger&rsquo;s chief claim to remembrance by
posterity rests upon the extraordinary part he bore in the exploration
of the West. The common verdict of his many employers,
from Robert Campbell down to Captain Raynolds, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
that as a guide he was without an equal. He was a born
topographer. The whole West was mapped out in his mind
as in an exhaustive atlas. Such was his instinctive sense of
locality and direction that it used to be said that he could
&ldquo;smell his way&rdquo; where he could not see it. He was not only
a good topographer in the field, but he could reproduce his
impressions in sketches. &ldquo;With a buffalo skin and a piece of
charcoal,&rdquo; says Captain Gunnison, &ldquo;he will map out any portion
of this immense region, and delineate mountains, streams,
and the circular valleys, called &lsquo;holes,&rsquo; with wonderful accuracy.&rdquo;
His ability in this line caused him always to be in
demand as guide to exploring parties, and his name is connected
with scores of prominent government and private expeditions.</p>

<p>His lifetime measures that period of our history during
which the West was changed from a trackless wilderness to
a settled and civilized country. He was among the first who
went to the mountains, and he lived to see all that had made
a life like his possible swept away forever. His name survives
in many a feature of our western geography, but in
none with greater honor than in this little lake among the
mountains that he knew so well; and near the source of that
majestic stream with which so much of his eventful life was
identified.</p>

<p><i>Delusion Lake</i> (7,850)&mdash;M: 9&mdash;1878&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;This
lake was long supposed to be an arm of the Yellowstone Lake,
and, in the fanciful comparison of the main lake to the form
of the human hand, occupied the position of the index finger.
The delusion consisted in this mistaken notion of a permanent
connection between the two lakes.</p>

<p><i>Hart Lake</i> (7,469)&mdash;P: 9&mdash;According to Hayden, &ldquo;long
known to the hunters of the region as Heart Lake.&rdquo; Named
prior to 1870 for an old hunter by the name of Hart Hunney
who in early times plied his trade in this vicinity. He was
possibly one of Bonneville&rsquo;s men, for he seems to have known
the General well and to have been familiar with his operations.
He was killed by a war party of Crows in 1852.</p>

<p>The spelling, <i>Heart</i>, dates from the expeditions of 1871. The
notion that the name arose from the shape of the lake seems
to have originated with Captain Barlow. It has generally
been accepted although there is really no similarity between
the form of the lake and that of a heart. Lewis Lake is the
only heart-shaped lake in that locality.</p>

camping-ground of Indians. &ldquo;My favorite camp on
the Yellowstone Lake (and it evidently has been a favorite one
for the Indian) has ever been upon the grove-dotted bluff,
elevated thirty or forty feet above the lake, directly fronting
Indian Pond.&rdquo;&mdash;Norris.</p>

<p><i>Jackson Lake</i> (6,000)&mdash;U-W: 6&mdash;Date unknown.&mdash;For
David Jackson, a noted mountaineer and fur trader, and one
of the first three partners of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.
This lake was discovered by John Colter and was
named by Clark <i>Lake Biddle</i>, in honor of Nicholas Biddle,
who first gave to the world an authentic edition of the
journal of the celebrated Lewis and Clark Expedition.</p>

<p><i>Jenny Lake</i>&mdash;South of Leigh Lake and off the map.&mdash;1872&mdash;U.
S. G. S.&mdash;For the wife of Richard Leigh. She was
a Shoshone Indian.</p>

<p><i>Leigh Lake</i>&mdash;W: 5&mdash;1872&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;For Richard
Leigh (&ldquo;Beaver Dick&rdquo;), a noted hunter, trapper, and guide
in the country around the Teton Mountains. The nickname
&ldquo;Beaver Dick&rdquo; arose, not from the fact that Leigh was an
expert beaver trapper, but on account of the striking resemblance
of two abnormally large front teeth in his upper jaw to
the teeth of a beaver. The Indians called him &ldquo;The Beaver.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Lewis Lake</i> (7,720)&mdash;O: 7&mdash;1872&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;For Captain
Lewis of &ldquo;Lewis and Clark&rdquo; fame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it had no name, so far as we could ascertain, we decided
to call it Lewis Lake, in memory of that gallant explorer
Captain Meriwether Lewis. The south fork of the Columbia,
which was to have perpetuated his name, has reverted
to its Indian title Shoshone, and is commonly known by that
name, or its translation, Snake River. As this lake lies near
the head of one of the principal forks of that stream, it may
not be inappropriately called Lewis Lake.&rdquo;&mdash;Bradley.<a name="FNanchor_CN_92" id="FNanchor_CN_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_CN_92" class="fnanchor">[CN]</a></p>

paragraph from his report for 1871:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We camped at night on the shore of a lake which seemed
to have no outlet. It is simply a depression which receives
the drainage of the surrounding hills. It is marshy around
the shores, and the surface is covered thickly with the leaves

describing the tour. The following extract is from his book:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We passed along the bank of a lovely little lakelet, sleeping
in seclusion in the shade of towering evergreens, by which
it is sheltered from the roaring tempests. It is near the divide,
and on its pebbly shore some members of our party unfurled
the Stars and Stripes, and christened it Mary&rsquo;s Lake,
in honor of Miss Clark, a young lady belonging to our party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This lake appears on Jones' map for the same year as Summit
Lake. Everts is said to have passed it in his wanderings,
but there is no reliable evidence to that effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lake Riddle&rsquo; is a fugitive name, which has been located
at several places, but nowhere permanently. It is supposed
to have been used originally to designate the mythical lake,
among the mountains, whence, according to the hunters,
water flowed to both oceans. I have agreed to Mr. Hering&rsquo;s
proposal to attach the name to this lake, which is directly
upon the divide at a point where the waters of the two oceans
start so nearly together, and thus to solve the unsolved &lsquo;riddle&rsquo;
of the &lsquo;two-ocean-water.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Bradley.<a name="FNanchor_CP_94" id="FNanchor_CP_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP_94" class="fnanchor">[CP]</a> This was a year
before Captain Jones verified the existence of Two-Ocean-Pass.</p>

<p><a name="Shoshone_Lake" id="Shoshone_Lake"></a><i>Shoshone Lake</i> (7,740)&mdash;M-N: 5-6&mdash;1872&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;From
Shoshone, or Snake River, which here finds its source.
This lake was first named De Lacy Lake, after its discoverer.
The Washburn Party (1870) appear to have named it after
their leader. In 1871, Doctor Hayden, failing to identify its
location, and believing it to be tributary to the Madison River,
renamed it Madison Lake. It is this name which appears on
the first map of the Park and in the Act of Dedication, where
the west boundary of the Park is described as being &ldquo;fifteen
miles west of the most western point of Madison Lake.&rdquo; In
1872, when the correct drainage of the lake was discovered,
the name &ldquo;Madison Lake&rdquo; was transferred to its present location
(See "<a href="#Madison_Lake">Madison Lake</a>"), and its place supplied by
&ldquo;Shoshone Lake.&rdquo; The Act of Dedication is therefore misleading,
and it is necessary to know that &ldquo;Madison Lake&rdquo; of
the Act, is &ldquo;Shoshone Lake&rdquo; now, in order to understand the
true location of the west boundary of the Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>In changing the name from &ldquo;De Lacy&rdquo; to &ldquo;Shoshone,&rdquo;
Prof. F. H. Bradley, of the United States Geological Survey,
took occasion to reflect severely and unjustifiably upon
De Lacy&rsquo;s work in mapping the country.<a name="FNanchor_CQ_95" id="FNanchor_CQ_95"></a>

<p>De Lacy felt deeply wronged by this action, and Dr. Hayden
promised him that he would set the matter right; but
nothing was done. At a later day, Colonel Norris endeavored
to do De Lacy tardy justice by placing his name on the
stream which enters the lake from the north and drains the
beautiful valley now crossed by the tourist route. This name
remained for several year&rsquo;s, when it also was removed by the
United States Geological Survey, and its place filled by
&ldquo;Heron Creek.&rdquo; During the past year, however, the name
&ldquo;De Lacy Creek&rdquo; has been restored.</p>

which flows through it. This lake was named, on the map
showing &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Route in 1807,&rdquo; Lake Eustis, in honor of
William Eustis, Secretary of War to President Madison, 1809
to 1812.</p>

<p>Later it appears as Sublette Lake, in honor of the noted
fur trader, William Sublette. It is even said at one time to
have borne the &ldquo;fugitive name,&rdquo; Riddle Lake. But it early
became known by its present name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The islands of this lake are seven in number. They seem
to have all been named by the United States Geological
Survey largely for the employes of the survey. They are:</p>

<p><i>Carrington Island.</i> For Campbell Carrington, zoologist.</p>

<p><i>Dot Island.</i> A mere dot on the map.</p>

<p><i>Frank Island.</i> For the brother of Henry W. Elliott, a
member of the Hayden Expedition of 1871. This Island
was renamed Belknap Island in 1875 by the members of
Secretary Belknap&rsquo;s party, who passed through the Park in
that year. The name, however, never came into use.</p>

<p><i>Molly Island.</i>&mdash;For the wife of Mr. Henry Gannett.</p>

<p><i>Peale Island.</i>&mdash;For Dr. A. C. Peale, author of the elaborate
report on thermal springs which appears in Hayden&rsquo;s report
for 1878.</p>

<p><i>Pelican Roost.</i>&mdash;Characteristic.</p>

<p><i>Stevenson Island.</i>&mdash;For James Stevenson.
See "<a href="#Stevenson_Mt">Mt. Stevenson</a>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The bays are also seven in number, of which only the following
merit notice:</p>

<p><i>Mary Bay.</i>&mdash;Named by Henry W. Elliott for Miss Mary
Force.</p>

<p><i>Thumb.</i>&mdash;From the old fancy that the form of the lake resembled
that of the human hand.</p>

<p><i>Bridge Bay.</i>&mdash;From Bridge Creek. See "<a href="#Bridge_Creek">Bridge Creek</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>The capes are thirteen in number. We need notice only
Signal Point, which was much used in signaling by the early
explorers; Steamboat Point, named from the Steamboat
Springs near by; and Storm Point, so named because it receives
the full force of the prevailing south-west winds from
across the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The Annie.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;The first boat on the Yellowstone Lake was
a small canvass craft 12 feet long by 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet wide. Dr. Hayden
records that, it was, christened <i>The Annie</i>, &ldquo;by Mr.
Stevenson, in compliment to Miss Anna L. Dawes, the amiable
daughter of Hon. H. L. Dawes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Hayden Valley</i> (7,800)&mdash;H-J: 8-10-1878&mdash;U.S.G.S.
For the eminent American geologist, Ferdinand Vandiveer
Hayden, M.D., LL. D.,
whose important part in the
history of the Yellowstone
National Park has been fully
set forth in previous pages.
The following condensed
sketch of his life is from the
pen of Dr. A. C. Peale:<a name="FNanchor_CR_96" id="FNanchor_CR_96"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_CR_96" class="fnanchor">[CR]</a></p>

<p>&#8230; "He was born at
Westfield, Mass., September
7, 1829&#8230;. His father
died when he was about ten
years of age, and about two
years later he went to live
with an uncle at Rochester, in
Lorain County, Ohio, where
he remained for six years. He taught in the country district
schools of the neighborhood during his sixteenth and seventeenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
years, and at the age of eighteen went to Oberlin College,
where he was graduated in 1850&#8230;.</p>

<p>"He studied medicine with Dr. J. S. Newberry, at Cleveland,
and at Albany was graduated Doctor of Medicine in the
early part of 1853. After his graduation, he was sent by
Prof. James Hall, of New York, to the Bad Lands of White
River, in Dakota. The years 1854 and 1855 he spent exploring
and collecting fossils in the Upper Missouri country,
mainly at his own expense. From 1856 until 1859, he was
connected as geologist with the expeditious of Lieutenant
Warren, engaged in explorations in Nebraska and Dakota.
From 1859 until 1862, he was surgeon, naturalist, and geologist
with Captain W. F. Raynolds, in the exploration of the
Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers. In October, 1862, he was
appointed acting assistant surgeon and assistant medical inspector
until June, 1865, when he resigned, and was brevetted
lieutenant-colonel for meritorious services during the
war. He then resumed his scientific work, and in 1866 made
another trip to the Bad Lands of Dakota, this time in the interest
of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
In 1865, he was elected professor of mineralogy and geology
in the University of Pennsylvania, which position he resigned
in 1872. From 1867 to 1879, his history is that of the organization
of which he had charge, which began as a geological
survey of Nebraska, and became finally the Geological
Survey of the Territories&#8230;. From 1879 until December,
1886, he was connected with the United States Geological
Survey as geologist. His health began to fail soon after
his connection with this organization, and gradually became
worse, and he lived only a year after his resignation.</p>

<p>"In 1876, the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him by
the University of Rochester, and in June, 1886, he received
the same degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He
was a member of seventeen scientific societies in the United
States, among them the National Academy of Sciences, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
was honorary and corresponding member of some seventy
foreign societies. A bibliography of his writings includes 158
titles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230; The gentleness and diffidence, approaching even
timidity, which impressed his fellow-students at Oberlin,
characterized Dr. Hayden throughout his life, and rendered
it somewhat difficult for those who did not know him intimately
to understand the reasons for his success, which was
undoubtedly due to his energy and perseverance, qualities
which were equally characteristic of him as a boy and student
and in later life. His desire to forward the cause of science
was sincere and enthusiastic, and he was always ready to
modify his views upon the presentation of evidence. He was
intensely nervous, frequently impulsive, but ever generous,
and his honesty and integrity undoubted. The greater part
of his work for the government and for science was a labor
of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Jones Pass</i> (9,450)&mdash;K: 12&mdash;1880&mdash;Norris&mdash;For its discoverer,
Captain W. A. Jones, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A.,
who passed through it in 1873.</p>

<p><i>Kingman Pass</i> (7,230)&mdash;D: 6&mdash;1883&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;The
pass of which Golden Gate is the northern entrance. For
Lieutenant D. C. Kingman, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A.,
who built the road through the pass.</p>

<p><i>Norris Geyser Basin</i> (7,527)&mdash;G-H: 6&mdash;For P. W. Norris,
who first explored and described it, and opened it up to tourists.
It was, however, discovered in 1872 by E. S. Topping
and Dwight Woodruff, who were led in that direction by noticing
from the summit of Bunsen Peak a vast column of
steam ascending to the southward. The day after this discovery,
a tourist party, including a Mr. and Mrs. H. H.
Stone, of Bozeman, Montana, visited it from Mammoth Hot
Springs, and then continued their course, by way of the general
line of the present route, to the Firehole Geyser Basin.
Mrs. Stone was the first white woman to visit the Park.</p>

<p><i>Raynolds Pass</i> (6,911)&mdash;Not on map.&mdash;Crosses the Continental
Divide to the northward of Henry Lake, and connects
the valley of Henry Fork with that of the Madison. Named
for Captain W. F. Raynolds, who led his expedition through
it in 1860.</p>

<p><i>Sylvan Pass</i> (8,650)&mdash;L : 13&mdash;1895&mdash;U. S. G. S.&mdash;Characteristic.</p>

<p><i>Targhee Pass</i> (7,063)&mdash;Not on map.&mdash;Crosses the Continental
Divide to the eastward of Henry Lake, and leads from the
valley of Henry Fork to that of the Madison. The origin
and orthography of this name are uncertain. In Hayden&rsquo;s
Report for 1872, occur three spellings, Targhee, Tyghee, and
Tahgee. The weight of evidence is in favor of the form
here adopted. There was an impression among the Hayden
Survey people, in 1872, that the name was given in honor of
some distinguished Indian Chief; but that there was no definite
information on the point is evident from the following
statements, taken from Hayden&rsquo;s Report for 1872. On page
56, it is stated that <i>Tahgee</i> Pass &ldquo;was named years ago for
the head chief of the Bannocks.&rdquo; On page 227, it is said
that <i>Tyghee</i> Pass &ldquo;was named for an old Shoshone chief who
was wont to use it.&rdquo; The real origin is thus left somewhat
obscure, but it is probable that the notion that the pass was
named for an Indian chief may have some foundation in
fact. There was living among the Bannocks within the
present memory of white men a chief whose name was pronounced
<i>Ti-gee</i>.</p>

uniform periodicity of action, is erroneous. There is only
one geyser of importance in the Park that can be depended

of every nature or description used by any person or persons
within said park limits when engaged in killing, trapping,
ensnaring, or capturing such wild beasts, birds, or wild animals
shall be forfeited to the United States, and may be seized by
the officers in said park and held pending the prosecution of
any person or persons arrested under charge of violating
the provisions of this Act, and upon conviction under this
Act of such person or persons using said guns, traps, teams,
horses, or other means of transportation, such forfeiture shall
be adjudicated as a penalty in addition to the other punishment
provided in this Act. Such forfeited property shall be
disposed and accounted for by and under the authority of the
Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> That the United States Circuit Court in said district
shall appoint a commissioner, who shall reside in the
park, who shall have jurisdiction to hear and act upon all
complaints made, of any and all violations of the law, or of
the rules and regulations made by the Secretary of the Interior
for the government of the park, and for the protection
of the animals, birds, and fish and objects of interest therein,
and for other purposes authorized by this Act. Such commissioner
shall have power, upon sworn information, to issue
process in the name of the United States for the arrest of any
person charged with the commission of any misdemeanor, or
charged with the violation of the rules and regulations, or
with the violation of any provision of this Act prescribed for
the government of said park, and for the protection of the
animals, birds, and fish in the said park, and to try the person
so charged, and, if found guilty, to impose the punishment
and adjudge the forfeiture prescribed. In all cases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
conviction, an appeal shall lie from the judgment of said commissioner
to the United States District Court for the district
of Wyoming, said appeal to be governed by the laws of the
State of Wyoming providing for appeals in cases of misdemeanor
from justices of the peace to the District Court of
said State; but the United States Circuit Court in said district
may prescribe rules of procedure and practice for said commissioner
in the trial of cases, and for appeal to said United
States District Court. Said commissioner shall also have
power to issue process as hereinbefore provided for the arrest
of any person charged with the commission of any felony
within the park, and to summarily hear the evidence introduced,
and, if he shall determine that probable cause is
shown for holding the person so charged for trial, shall cause
such person to be safely conveyed to a secure place for confinement,
within the jurisdiction of the United States District
Court in said State of Wyoming, and shall certify a transcript
of the record of his proceedings and the testimony in the case
to the said court, which court shall have jurisdiction of the
case; provided, that the said commissioner shall grant bail in
all cases bailable under the laws of the United States or of
said State. All process issued by the commissioner shall be
directed to the marshal of the United States for the district
of Wyoming; but nothing herein contained shall be construed
as preventing the arrest by any officer of the government
or employe of the United States in the park, without
process, of any person taken in the act of violating the law or
any regulation of the Secretary of the Interior; provided,
that the said commissioner shall only exercise such authority
and powers as are conferred by this Act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> That the marshal of the United States for the district
of Wyoming may appoint one or more deputy marshals

United States District and Circuit Courts shall hold one session
of said courts annually at the town of Sheridan, in the

State of Wyoming, and may also hold other sessions at any
other place in said State of Wyoming, or in said National
Park, at such dates as the said courts may order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> That the commissioner provided for in this Act
shall, in addition to the fees allowed by law to commissioners
of the Circuit Courts of the United States, be paid an annual
salary of one thousand dollars, payable quarterly, and the
marshal of the United States, and his deputies, and the attorney
of the United States and his assistants in said district,
shall be paid the same compensation and fees as are now
provided by law for like services in said district.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 8.</span> That all costs and expenses arising in cases under
this Act, and properly chargeable to the United States, shall
be certified, approved, and paid as like costs and expenses in

paid under the laws of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 9.</span> That the Secretary of the Interior shall cause to be
erected in the park a suitable building to be used as a jail,
and also having in said building an office for the use of the
commissioner, the cost of such building not to exceed five
thousand dollars, to be paid out of any moneys in the Treasury
not otherwise appropriated, upon the certificate of the
Secretary as a voucher therefor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 10.</span> That this act shall not be construed to repeal existing
laws conferring upon the Secretary of the Interior and
the Secretary of War certain powers with reference to the
protection, improvement, and control of the said Yellowstone
National Park.</p>

<p class="references">An act concerning leases in the Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<p><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That the Secretary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of the Interior is hereby authorized and empowered to
lease to any person, corporation, or company, for a period not
exceeding ten years, at such annual rental as the Secretary
of the Interior may determine, parcels of land in the Yellowstone
National Park, of not more than ten acres in extent for
each tract, and not in excess of twenty acres in all to any one
person, corporation, or company, on which maybe erected hotels
and necessary out-buildings; provided, that such lease or
leases shall not include any of the geysers or other objects of
curiosity or interest in said park, or exclude the public from
free and convenient approach thereto, or include any ground
within one-eighth of a mile of any of the geysers or the Yellowstone
Falls, the Grand Cañon, or the Yellowstone River,
Mammoth Hot Springs, or any object of curiosity in the
park; and provided, further, that such leases shall not convey,
either expressly or by implication, any exclusive privilege
within the park except upon the premises held thereunder

Congress, and every rule, order, or regulation made, or which
may hereafter be made and published by the Secretary of the
Interior concerning the use, care, management, or government
of the park, or any object or property therein, under penalty
of forfeiture of such lease, and every such lease shall be subject
to the right of revocation and forfeiture, which shall
therein be reserved by the Secretary of the Interior; and provided,
further, that persons or corporations now holding leases
of ground in the park may, upon the surrender thereof, be
granted new leases hereunder, and upon the terms and stipulations
contained in their present leases, with such modifications,
restrictions, and reservations as the Secretary of the
Interior may prescribe.</p>

<p>This Act, however, is not to be construed as mandatory

V. Hayden, with sub-reports by W. H. Holmes, Dr. A. C.
Peale and Henry Gannett. Washington: Government
Printing Office. 1883. This report contains Dr. Peale&rsquo;s
exhaustive treatise upon the thermal phenomena of the park;
his general treatise on the hot springs and geysers of the
world, and his elaborate bibliography pertaining to these
subjects.</p>

<p><a name="bibl_12" id="bibl_12"></a>12. Annual Reports of the United States Geological Survey.
The serial numbers of these reports begin with June
30, 1880, the first report being for the year ending at that
time. Nearly all these reports contain valuable references to
the Park, most of them being from the pen of Prof. Arnold
Hague. One article of great importance, by Walter Harvey
Weed (Ninth Annual Report, 1888, pp. 613-676), on the
formation of hot springs deposits through the agency of
vegetable growth, deserves particular notice. Washington:

to give a full list of them. Among those who have
prepared guides or manuals of the Park, of practical value to
the tourist, may be mentioned H. J. Norton, P. W. Norris,
Henry J. Winser, G. L. Henderson, W. W. &amp; S. K. Wiley,
W. C. Riley, F. J. Haynes, A. B. Guptill, and the Northern

Government Printing Office.</p>

<p>This book, of which only twelve copies were ever made, is
the record of the journey of President Arthur through the
Park as the guest of Lieutenant-General Sheridan in 1883.
The dispatches were mostly written by Lieutenant-Colonel M.
V. Sheridan, Military Secretary, and by Lieutenant-Colonel
James F. Gregory, Aide-de-Camp; but at least one dispatch
was written by each of the other members of the party, except
the President. All the dispatches were read to and approved
by the President before being sent. No newspaper
correspondent accompanied the expedition. The photographs,
which form an important feature of the book, were taken by
F. J. Haynes, who accompanied the party.</p>

A publication by the United States Geological Survey, consisting
of four geological and four topographical maps; a descriptive
text by Prof. Arnold Hague, of the United States
Geological Survey; and a geological text by Prof. Hague as
Geologist in Charge, assisted by Messrs. J. P. Iddings, W.
H. Weed, and G. M. Wright. It is understood that this Folio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
is presently to be followed by an exhaustive Monograph upon
the Park.</p>

<p><a name="bibl_158" id="bibl_158"></a>158. Yellowstone National Park Game Exploration. E.
Hough. Under the above title a series of thirteen articles appeared
in <i>Forest and Stream</i> in the summer of 1894, the first
article appearing in the issue of May 5, and the last in that of
August 25 of that year. These articles are of great interest
and value as forming probably the most complete discussion of
the game question in the Park that has yet appeared. Their
descriptions of snow-shoe traveling and of the winter scenery
of that region are well worthy of perusal. The graphic narrative
of the arrest of the poacher, Howell, is an important
feature.</p>
